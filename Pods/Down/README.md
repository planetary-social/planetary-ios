### Installation

Note: Swift support is summarized in the table below.

|Swift Version|Tag|
| --- | --- |
| Swift 5.1 | >= 0.9.2 |
| Swift 5.0 | >= 0.8.1 |
| Swift 4 | >= 0.4.x |
| Swift 3 | 0.3.x |

 now on the `master` branch and any tag >= 0.8.1 (Swift 4 is >= 0.4.x, Swift 3 is 0.3.x)

Quickly install using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org):

```ruby
pod 'Down'
```

Or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage):

```
github "iwasrobbed/Down"
```
Due to limitations in Carthage regarding platform specification, you need to define the platform with Carthage.

e.g.

```carthage update --platform iOS```

Or manually install:

1. Clone this repository
2. Drag and drop the Down project into your workspace file, adding the framework in the embedded framework section
2. Build and run your app
4. ?
5. Profit

### Robust Performance

>[cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) can render a Markdown version of War and Peace in the blink of an eye (127 milliseconds on a ten year old laptop, vs. 100-400 milliseconds for an eye blink). In our [benchmarks](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark/blob/master/benchmarks.md), cmark is 10,000 times faster than the original Markdown.pl, and on par with the very fastest available Markdown processors.

> The library has been extensively fuzz-tested using [american fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl). The test suite includes pathological cases that bring many other Markdown parsers to a crawl (for example, thousands-deep nested bracketed text or block quotes).

### Output Formats
* Web View (see DownView class)
* HTML
* XML
* LaTeX
* groff man
* CommonMark Markdown
* NSAttributedString
* AST (abstract syntax tree)

### View Rendering

The `DownView` class offers a very simple way to parse a UTF-8 encoded string with Markdown and convert it to a web view that can be added to any view:

```swift
let downView = try? DownView(frame: self.view.bounds, markdownString: "**Oh Hai**") {
    // Optional callback for loading finished
}
// Now add to view or constrain w/ Autolayout
// Or you could optionally update the contents at some point:
try? downView?.update(markdownString:  "## [Google](https://google.com)") {
    // Optional callback for loading finished
}
```

### Parsing API

The `Down` struct has everything you need if you just want out-of-the-box setup for parsing and conversion.

```swift
let down = Down(markdownString: "## [Down](https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Down)")

// Convert to HTML
let html = try? down.toHTML()
// "<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Down\">Down</a></h2>\n"

// Convert to XML
let xml = try? down.toXML()
// "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE document SYSTEM \"CommonMark.dtd\">\n<document xmlns=\"http://commonmark.org/xml/1.0\">\n  <heading level=\"2\">\n    <link destination=\"https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Down\" title=\"\">\n      <text>Down</text>\n    </link>\n  </heading>\n</document>\n"

// Convert to groff man
let man = try? down.toGroff()
// ".SS\nDown (https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Down)\n"

// Convert to LaTeX
let latex = try? down.toLaTeX()
// "\\subsection{\\href{https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Down}{Down}}\n"

// Convert to CommonMark Markdown
let commonMark = try? down.toCommonMark()
// "## [Down](https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Down)\n"

// Convert to an attributed string
let attributedString = try? down.toAttributedString()
// NSAttributedString representation of the rendered HTML;
// by default, uses a stylesheet that matches NSAttributedString's default font,
// but you can override this by passing in your own, using the 'stylesheet:' parameter.

// Convert to abstract syntax tree
let ast = try? down.toAST()
// Returns pointer to AST that you can manipulate

```

### Rendering Granularity

If you'd like more granularity for the output types you want to support, you can create your own struct conforming to at least one of the renderable protocols:

* DownHTMLRenderable
* DownXMLRenderable
* DownLaTeXRenderable
* DownGroffRenderable
* DownCommonMarkRenderable
* DownASTRenderable
* DownAttributedStringRenderable

Example:

```swift
public struct MarkdownToHTML: DownHTMLRenderable {
    /**
     A string containing CommonMark Markdown
    */
    public var markdownString: String

    /**
     Initializes the container with a CommonMark Markdown string which can then be rendered as HTML using `toHTML()`

     - parameter markdownString: A string containing CommonMark Markdown

     - returns: An instance of Self
     */
    @warn_unused_result
    public init(markdownString: String) {
        self.markdownString = markdownString
    }
}
```

### Configuration of `DownView`

`DownView` can be configured with a custom bundle using your own HTML / CSS or to do things like supporting
Dynamic Type or custom fonts, etc. It's completely configurable.

This option can be found in [DownView's instantiation function](https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Down/blob/master/Source/Views/DownView.swift#L26).

##### Prevent zoom

The default implementation of the `DownView` allows for zooming in the rendered content. If you want to disable this, then youâ€™ll need to instantiate the `DownView` with a custom bundle where the `viewport` in `index.html` has been assigned `user-scalable=no`. More info can be found [here](https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Down/pull/30).

### Options

Each protocol has options that will influence either rendering or parsing:

```swift
/**
 Default options
*/
public static let `default` = DownOptions(rawValue: 0)

// MARK: - Rendering Options

/**
 Include a `data-sourcepos` attribute on all block elements
*/
public static let sourcePos = DownOptions(rawValue: 1 << 1)

/**
 Render `softbreak` elements as hard line breaks.
*/
public static let hardBreaks = DownOptions(rawValue: 1 << 2)

/**
 Suppress raw HTML and unsafe links (`javascript:`, `vbscript:`,
 `file:`, and `data:`, except for `image/png`, `image/gif`,
 `image/jpeg`, or `image/webp` mime types).  Raw HTML is replaced
 by a placeholder HTML comment. Unsafe links are replaced by
 empty strings. Note that this option is provided for backwards
 compatibility, but safe mode is now the default.
*/
public static let safe = DownOptions(rawValue: 1 << 3)

/**
 Allow raw HTML and unsafe links. Note that safe mode is now
 the default, and the unsafe option must be used if rendering
 of raw HTML and unsafe links is desired.
*/
public static let unsafe = DownOptions(rawValue: 1 << 17)

// MARK: - Parsing Options

/**
 Normalize tree by consolidating adjacent text nodes.
*/
public static let normalize = DownOptions(rawValue: 1 << 4)

/**
 Validate UTF-8 in the input before parsing, replacing illegal
 sequences with the replacement character U+FFFD.
*/
public static let validateUTF8 = DownOptions(rawValue: 1 << 5)

/**
 Convert straight quotes to curly, --- to em dashes, -- to en dashes.
*/
public static let smart = DownOptions(rawValue: 1 << 6)

/**
 Combine smart typography with HTML rendering.
*/
public static let smartUnsaFe = DownOptions(rawValue: (1 << 17) + (1 << 6))
```
