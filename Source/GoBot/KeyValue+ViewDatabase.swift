    /// Creates a KeyValue from a database row. Copied from ViewDatabase.swift, still very messy. It's unclear what
    /// columns are required for this function to succeed, but in general I think it's messages joined with message keys
    /// joined with the post type (i.e posts) joined with authors. See `ViewDatabase.fillMessages` for a working
    /// example.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - row: The SQLite row that should be used to make the KeyValue.
    ///   - database: A database instance that will be used to fetch supplementary information.
    ///   - useNamespacedTables: A boolean that tells the initializer to include table names before some common column
    ///     names that appear in multiple tables like `name`.
    ///   - hasMentionColumns: A flag that lets the parser know whether the row includes the columns `hasblobs`,
    ///     `has_feed_mentions`, `has_message_mentions`. These columns are an optimization to speed up the loading of
    ///     Posts.
    ///   - hasReplies: A flag that lets the parse know whether the row `replies_count` and `replies` columns as an
    ///     optimization for loading post replies.
