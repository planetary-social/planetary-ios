# 5. Use SPM for major internal components

Date: 2022-02-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The idea is to modularize the source code of Planetary in different components to keep the code more organized and prevent dependencies from permeating different parts of the code.

## Decision

The following guide was followed: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/organizing_your_code_with_local_packages.
Local Swift packages will be used to create major internal components.

## Consequences

- Developing code for an internal component will be a bit harder to do. Public classes, structs and functions will be placed in a Delivery folder of the component, and everything
else should be internal or lower, this will privent ourselves from breaking abstractions because the outside world wont't use internal functions from a component, but designing the
what is going to be public has to be done carefully.
