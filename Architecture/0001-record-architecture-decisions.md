# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-01-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. Recording them will help us communicate to the team when architecture is changing and why, and it helps us re-evaluate past decisions when we want to change them.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
