# Contributing

For now `master` is the main branch and code improvements are made in topic branches that get merged into it. Eventually there will be specific release branches, but for now `master` is the release branch.

1. Create a branch named `initials-topic` or ticket tag like `esw-190`
2. Make commits at whatever pace/detail necessary (these are mostly for your benefit)
3. Push your named branch
4. Add a short description of what the PR accomplishes
5. If possible add screenshots (use shift-command-4-space-click to capture the iOS simulator window)
6. Wait for a Member to approve and merge your code

Due to the small team size, code reviews are mostly to inform other members what's going on. Use GitHub's inline comment feature to leave notes for others to read and reply.

### Merging a Pull Request

Members only:
1. Select "Squash and merge" from the drop-down Merge button.
2. Delete the branch (as the UI recommends) to keep the repo clean.
