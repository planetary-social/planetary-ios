I have some experience in this area. I recently completed a [film](http://www.aneweconomy.ca) on how groups cooperate and collaborate in value exchange and wealth—including #loomio, contact with the #enspiral folks, #Sensorica, The Embassy Network and many others.\n\nThe filming process exposed me to [John Fullerton](www.capitalinstitute.org)'s work, which is highly relevant to the development of #verse and the growth of the #ssb community. John's an ex-managing director at JP Morgan who deeply understands economics from a practical viewpoint—both extractive capital and something better, a pattern he's calling Regenerative Economics. He's dedicated the last few decades to finding the principles & patterns of sustainable economic systems. His group has developed [eight principles](http://capitalinstitute.org/8-principles-regenerative-economy/) (and a few useful [stories](http://fieldguide.capitalinstitute.org/stories.html) ) that could profoundly assist in guiding what #verse becomes.\n\nFor example, two principles that are relevant as #verse emerges—a regenerative system:\n\n> (2) Views wealth holistically: True wealth is not merely money in the bank. It must be defined and managed in terms of the well-being of the whole, achieved through the harmonization of multiple kinds of wealth or capital, including social, cultural, living, and experiential. It must also be defined by a broadly shared prosperity across all of these varied forms of capital. The whole is only as strong as the weakest link.\n\n(For #verse, this could mean going beyond a B-corp to make sure that profit and wealth generated by building on top of the commons flows back into the commons.)\n\n> (5) Honors Community and Place: Each human community consists of a mosaic of peoples, traditions, beliefs, and institutions uniquely shaped by long-term pressures of geography, human history, culture, local environment, and changing human needs. Honoring this fact, a Regenerative Economy nurtures healthy and resilient communities and regions, each one uniquely informed by the essence of its individual history and place.\n\n(In this case, honoring the p2p nature of scuttlebutt where the technical infrastructure mirrors the social fabric creates possibilities for innovative and potentially groundbreaking ways of organizing a business.)\n\nI'd highly encourage [@rabble](@vzoU7/XuBB5B0xueC9NHFr9Q76VvPktD9GUkYgN9lAc=.ed25519), [@Tom Coates](@7A2ZxHX+WyIVezulnt0FogzeUVWLq3YHmtX3r7ja4Fw=.ed25519) and others who are looking into how to create a healthy engagement to build wealth in this #commons / community to have a read of John's [research (whitepaper - PDF)](http://capitalinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-Regenerative-Capitalism-4-20-15-final.pdf) and possibly reach out to him (I can make an introduction if needed).\n\nThe difference between a well-structured, well-governed economic engagement and an extractive one is profound. I feel if the #ssb community can get this right with #verse, it may be a very positive example for others to aspire to.\n\nSince I'm not sure exactly how conversations work yet here, tagging a few people who seem to be most engaged with this conversation: [@elavoie](@IgYpd+tCtXnlE2tYX/8rR2AGt+P8svC98WH3MdYAa8Y=.ed25519) [@andrestaltz](@QlCTpvY7p9ty2yOFrv1WU1AE88aoQc4Y7wYal7PFc+w=.ed25519) [@Alanna](@6OxffMLNyxkboLjCqv29WnMPhH8O3qFrcXCR6KrKcPI=.ed25519) [@Dominic](@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519) [@mix](@ye+QM09iPcDJD6YvQYjoQc7sLF/IFhmNbEqgdzQo3lQ=.ed25519)","mentions":[{"link":"#new-people"},{"link":"#verse"},{"link":"@vzoU7/XuBB5B0xueC9NHFr9Q76VvPktD9GUkYgN9lAc=.ed25519","name":"rabble"},{"link":"#loomio"},{"link":"#enspiral"},{"link":"#Sensorica"},{"link":"#verse"},{"link":"#ssb"},{"link":"#verse"},{"link":"#verse"},{"link":"#verse"},{"link":"@vzoU7/XuBB5B0xueC9NHFr9Q76VvPktD9GUkYgN9lAc=.ed25519","name":"rabble"},{"link":"@7A2ZxHX+WyIVezulnt0FogzeUVWLq3YHmtX3r7ja4Fw=.ed25519","name":"Tom Coates"},{"link":"#commons"},{"link":"#ssb"},{"link":"#verse"},{"link":"@IgYpd+tCtXnlE2tYX/8rR2AGt+P8svC98WH3MdYAa8Y=.ed25519","name":"elavoie"},{"link":"@QlCTpvY7p9ty2yOFrv1WU1AE88aoQc4Y7wYal7PFc+w=.ed25519","name":"andrestaltz"},{"link":"@6OxffMLNyxkboLjCqv29WnMPhH8O3qFrcXCR6KrKcPI=.ed25519","name":"Alanna"},{"link":"@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519","name":"Dominic"},{"link":"@ye+QM09iPcDJD6YvQYjoQc7sLF/IFhmNbEqgdzQo3lQ=.ed25519","name":"mix"}]},"signature":"6bnFXwyxBLwAoFC4JFIgjuGJ5P6PHYrmiltrwC/TuFPCEZOtlCem2FGJygO5djrxH9arKUb7+D7Jdm7JAou7DA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1539266933003,"rts":1539201882696},{"key":"%pGpwaKX6wup9vhcBIbYSr6hseDMcKZtZBtPDOGllXJs=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%2f0EtOuEmreXGScJQ4hUDWBLjvDMS+AEQxwfb4gxMjA=.sha256","author":"@7CAUDnhwjZP0pDrhNjWgwPx77nRJnJL04l6N1YHk/Qw=.ed25519","sequence":51,"timestamp":1539202023289,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"about","about":"@7CAUDnhwjZP0pDrhNjWgwPx77nRJnJL04l6N1YHk/Qw=.ed25519","description":"traveller, photographer, filmmaker, storyteller\n\nhttp://trevormeier.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/trevormeier"},"signature":"FcBGCfYoewzWzY1q6tuggItBx/fs/a3msZr1Dn2jz/oY8T9Kz3N+XmQqsZF22BljUS1rxZ4s8kNvS1SiIvGXDQ==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1539266933032.002,"rts":1539202023289},{"key":"%iSZy4sNb1UbpqXv+isupfGhf2s0QOW+xI9fdpO81mIw=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%7Q7N1uAddr/+ew4adcMN/bds2hi6qbdi4YsV/lHwYOU=.sha256","author":"@7CAUDnhwjZP0pDrhNjWgwPx77nRJnJL04l6N1YHk/Qw=.ed25519","sequence":53,"timestamp":1539210144729,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%2f0EtOuEmreXGScJQ4hUDWBLjvDMS+AEQxwfb4gxMjA=.sha256","branch":"%RD8DpAi8Tlpilxnl0wAG2i3dpknlCZDa5SWRLK26hsw=.sha256","reply":{"%2f0EtOuEmreXGScJQ4hUDWBLjvDMS+AEQxwfb4gxMjA=.sha256":"@7CAUDnhwjZP0pDrhNjWgwPx77nRJnJL04l6N1YHk/Qw=.ed25519","%RD8DpAi8Tlpilxnl0wAG2i3dpknlCZDa5SWRLK26hsw=.sha256":"@ye+QM09iPcDJD6YvQYjoQc7sLF/IFhmNbEqgdzQo3lQ=.ed25519"},"channel":"verse","recps":null,"text":"Hey [@mix](@ye+QM09iPcDJD6YvQYjoQc7sLF/IFhmNbEqgdzQo3lQ=.ed25519) —yep, spot on. The film aligns directly with what you could call a gardening approach. Big ideas have to work in the here and now (something all of the stories in the film wrestle with). Curious if what pushed your buttons in the trailer is Ben's inclusion and your Loomio connections, or something else in the trailer? For example one of our main stories in the film links people on the street with mental health / addiction issues into work that's profitable and dignified while being appropriately supportive.

Current not-so-great options include:\n1. Sell to Netflix / a distributor and be subject to their exclusivity and restrictions, in exchange for a partial return on the cost of production\n2. Attempt to crowdfund / sell directly to viewers (but when's the last time you paid for a film?)\n3. Raise money from funds willing to lose the large up-front cost of making a film, and give the film away (if it's hard to raise $200k to give away to something as amazing as #ssb, think how hard it is to raise 2-5x that to make a film)\n\nIt's an impossible problem, and I think if places like #scuttleville can solve it in the micro, it can start a cultural & technological transformation where hopefully the next generation of visual storytellers coming up will be able to find a sustainable way of living without having to sell their art/community-crafted knowledge as an asset within the capitalist system (which is the solution I'm stuck with for the moment).\n\nHowever... if anyone has any amazing ideas on how I can pay my crew and pay my rent while making these films...

Upstream Color was an ambitious second take.\n\nCamera crew pay is an interesting topic. In a major centre in Canada I typically pay a day rate, between $350/d (for admin help) up to about $1000/d (for an experienced cinematographer). A typical documentary crew is four: me (director), field producer, camera, sound. Add the equipment and a shooting day is $4000-$7000/day on the low end and goes much, much higher. For example, there's a sequence of a string quartet in the film—we paid union standard wages for the quartet, plus rented the recording studio, plus the studio staff, plus a high-end DP & equipment, meals, some transport, etc. That day probably cost us closer to $22,000 CAD. \n\nPart of the economics of all of this is that camera crews work a handful of days a month. They spend a good 50% of their time not working, between gigs, networking to find more work. Plus there's high capital costs for equipment that's always being updated and renewed.\n\nThere's lots more I can go into, but it's tough to make a film for less than $150k (two people) or about $350k (four-person crew & proper finishing).","mentions":[]},"signature":"aTA9q+V6yPlagAA8mD1W2x6x/X1zxDU5az/JuFhbWdgk8Lb/qwIFys/Mpuu9VQ9127o0iHkaIqbwu9yTZTfFBw==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1539266933295.004,"rts":1539213105754},{"key":"%vhqf1t0bOPqXcpFYl2p4lGmNMxbxnJYnZxOsxAsVEuc=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%To2QNSZET3gyaZPfP/C77WM/8R5eRl7g4GqvBCMH9FA=.sha256","author":"@7CAUDnhwjZP0pDrhNjWgwPx77nRJnJL04l6N1YHk/Qw=.ed25519","sequence":60,"timestamp":1539217201556,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%2f0EtOuEmreXGScJQ4hUDWBLjvDMS+AEQxwfb4gxMjA=.sha256","branch":"%rrLiI+5InyQ6okh3bBbdRL6fMLI7jl4lrFgzJY5iuKM=.sha256","reply":{"%2f0EtOuEmreXGScJQ4hUDWBLjvDMS+AEQxwfb4gxMjA=.sha256":"@7CAUDnhwjZP0pDrhNjWgwPx77nRJnJL04l6N1YHk/Qw=.ed25519","%rrLiI+5InyQ6okh3bBbdRL6fMLI7jl4lrFgzJY5iuKM=.sha256":"@vzoU7/XuBB5B0xueC9NHFr9Q76VvPktD9GUkYgN9lAc=.ed25519"},"channel":"verse","recps":null,"text":"I don't think co-ops are necessarily the answer.

It's good to see your thoughts out in the open and I think continuing that process as your thoughts develop will benefit the whole community.\n\nFor those who are against content monetization... I would *love* it if y'all had a real solution that isn't:\n1. Selling a product\n2. Advertising\n\n... because as someone who works on creating content full-time, it's really, really difficult for me buy food, pay rent and pay my crew. I'm certainly less well-off than most of the people who watch my films—and I'm OK with that, but anything like #verse that makes a try at a #sustainable #decentralized #indie content ecosystem is a very positive move in my books.\n\nRight now content-makers like me are stuck in a very difficult situation. Either submit to the big three and build value on their platforms, develop your own products/advertising/funding platform, or work with the traditional media ecosystems (a la Netflix, HBO etc.) None of these are attractive solutions if independence and freedom of expression are what you're after.\n\nSo, I'm supportive of #verse giving it a shot and seeing what they come up with.

I think the mental heuristic of automated payments, though, is too bolt-on for the existing web. I don't think people get it, or if they do it doesn't fill a \"job to be done\" for them—the same reason Flattr struggled to get traction.\n\nI think Patreon is on to something because they help build a relationship between the creator and the audience. It's specific, explicit, and low-friction. On-boarding is simple, and once you're in the Patreon system, adding a new creator is ultra-low friction. There's more of a conversation and choice instead of a generalized algorithm.\n\nInstead of a bolt-on to the old web like Flattr, I think the opportunity lies in this emergence of a new, independent web (through SSB, DAT and other protocols) to have the consideration of paying content creators be a basic element of the social contract. Making it frictionless to support someone you like, who's contributing to the commons or in some other way through their content, can be the next step.

OnlyOffice is working on a blockchain-based decentralized collaboration system for their desktop apps, but not sure when that will be available.\n\nSo... it's a space with lots of room for a solid new entrant.","mentions":[]},"signature":"GMW9nAW6y0ILYqabtyTAULqhvIKKeOdDqwc2/R4AWgbBZ9JbP9wfa/kK2OhXdnM7MBVRWBFuItnecE5JFu91CA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1540997916477.004,"rts":1540595036883},{"key":"%lNpGTxZqKsOPIx6H2HXL/BAbMXuLt2I+QKYXEJVYWKw=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%+KBtScFJAUslKCQJXFZpQ59CKnIRnNGvMT7ryTzCtgE=.sha256","author":"@7CAUDnhwjZP0pDrhNjWgwPx77nRJnJL04l6N1YHk/Qw=.ed25519","sequence":154,"timestamp":1542744235623,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%1TuDOEBKtSPYj/ctsL9oEhS0Yoh3KVAJkLUBzzr1Qmo=.sha256","branch":["%UVTYdZo995/Csv7ChsMif06wo41mNabaRfjX88ipRqI=.sha256","%fPBVehs2U3QhvuBiSZw4pZO3mMJzlXyj6lK2IpLzeDc=.sha256"],"reply":{"%1TuDOEBKtSPYj/ctsL9oEhS0Yoh3KVAJkLUBzzr1Qmo=.sha256":"@vzoU7/XuBB5B0xueC9NHFr9Q76VvPktD9GUkYgN9lAc=.ed25519","%UVTYdZo995/Csv7ChsMif06wo41mNabaRfjX88ipRqI=.sha256":"@NeB4q4Hy9IiMxs5L08oevEhivxW+/aDu/s/0SkNayi0=.ed25519"},"channel":"verse","recps":null,"text":"Congrats on the funding!

Some of these challenges have been or are in the midst of being solved, but none have yet come together as a complete ecosystem, sufficient enough to be form a nascent Web3 equivalent of a LAMP stack or JAMstack.\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed in my surfing around the P2P and federated world: the existing system of NATs, IPv4 and DNS is a major limitation to the P2P web. There needs to be some kind of decentralized DNS to make human-friendly the machine-readable keys of Web3. Projects like Yggdrasil or #Hyperswarm are essential building blocks—tools that allow computers to connect directly to each other.\n\nAs the toolsets are developed, three significant issues appear:\n\n1. Security\n2. Privacy\n3. Performance\n\nSecurity: as soon as you have direct access to any single machine on the web, it’s available as a direct target to anyone globally.\n\nPrivacy: a single global address tied per machine or client is tantamount to an identity, which makes it a target for tracking, dragnet surveillance, targeted hacking etc.\n\nPerformance: it's a mobile world. On mobile you need access to what’s most recent and relevant, and it must be performant over a constrained connection on a small device. Yet you still need to access and search your whole archive. This quickly becomes a limitation of on mobile devices, especially when #onboarding new users who essentially have to download the entire reachable P2P web before they can view it. This is a significant design problem for the P2P web. (The Fastmail folks said it elegantly in reference to not including e2e encryption their new [JMAP email spec](https://jmap.io/#end-to-end-encryption): you don’t want to have to download your entire inbox in order to search it.)\n\nI’m excited to see if something akin to the LAMP stack emerges for Web3 that has useable answers to these questions. #scuttlebutt is getting close, as the community grapples with solutions for nascent mobile apps while keeping things P2P. The concept of pubs and having the tech mirror real social networks is unique in the P2P world. I’m excited to see what the community comes up with.

In the absence of governance, transparency can help prevent shocks and allow the existing ad-hoc governance and tacit knowledge systems to function with better information. \n\nWhat if, while governance and some of these issues are sorted out, you take a posture of more transparency? I think if you were to spend some of your creative energy on keeping a deeper and more regular dialogue with the SSB community, it would help alleviate the frustration that's flowing out of an (otherwise positive) announcement like this. For example, as other devs have done, you could post regular updates on feature ideas for comment and discussion with the possibility of adapting your decisions. Its not a formal structure, but a conversation with an invested community. Especially things like a new encoding format are extremely significant, as are philosophical choices about whether to include new members in the existing SSB community ecosystem. It's good that you're discussing these things with other devs. Perhaps take it a step further and sum up these discussions with a post for the wider community to allow greater circulation and elaboration?\n\nIt seems like in your posts these technical / philosophical / policy / values issues are somewhat conflated and the thinking to us outsiders isn't clear. This leads to frustration and confusion. If you spend more time on transparency of both your thinking process, decisions and ideas on a regular basis, it will help keep these discussions productive and useful to the community, and help keep the tone and decision-making positive (which I truly believe is your intention).\n\nMy ¢0.000002\n","mentions":[{"link":"@THUzexG1y6kWofwiN8Lix/jNH/P6roYdlCDgpAn2HSc=.ed25519","name":"Rabble"}]},"signature":"rYa2M3j+oJD+9I6Wnuj7ZQlOwgphR3VE0i5gzRBJzup35MXIy3KiSI3GqjGg/4EyPwTGVuFzAiF/QAJxEzsGAA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1571149880047,"rts":1570898606888},{"key":"%GBwaY4nhecW3PDJQTwExoandquKus0RbCJxscc6HTB4=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%tvGScSpJ0Baw8fYkZk/fXJ6hdAb/5Hamj8BOxQrMFCY=.sha256","sequence":174,"author":"@7CAUDnhwjZP0pDrhNjWgwPx77nRJnJL04l6N1YHk/Qw=.ed25519","timestamp":1570989186727,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%DwEdO79LsjwSsXa8sCkQpEkPSz/swZmUy2kc5/+OKHI=.sha256","fork":"%SD3WszbEsswbRHhj6cCffcKD2ZhwF6iJ/OCKwQmLGOY=.sha256","branch":"%My2NWD40ugeKO2dnGev8OF4O00RzEVOqNNnUxWbcWEw=.sha256","reply":{"%DwEdO79LsjwSsXa8sCkQpEkPSz/swZmUy2kc5/+OKHI=.sha256":"@THUzexG1y6kWofwiN8Lix/jNH/P6roYdlCDgpAn2HSc=.ed25519","%My2NWD40ugeKO2dnGev8OF4O00RzEVOqNNnUxWbcWEw=.sha256":"@IgYpd+tCtXnlE2tYX/8rR2AGt+P8svC98WH3MdYAa8Y=.ed25519"},"channel":null,"recps":null,"text":"[@Rabble](@THUzexG1y6kWofwiN8Lix/jNH/P6roYdlCDgpAn2HSc=.ed25519) I think the confusion comes from timing. If you were communicating these things to the non-dev SSB crowd as they are happening (in simple terms like your announcement) they would be easier to digest and discuss as things progress. Instead there are negative responses to your announcement. Why? I'd say a combination of major changes, surprise, and a lack of trust (which in my view comes from a combination of the power you hold and a lack of timely transparency). \n\nTwo out of three of the posts you mentioned were created in reaction to your announcement, defending the choices that have been made. The third  (the detailed post by [@Aljoscha](@zurF8X68ArfRM71dF3mKh36W0xDM8QmOnAS5bYOq8hA=.ed25519) goes in-depth; but it doesn't reference #planetary at all. At the end it states \"Any new self-describing data format to become part of SSB must support feed identifiers and message identifiers for all prior formats.\" If a non-dev reads this, it creates a sense that anyone making changes would take on the responsibility of keeping things compatible—but your announcement gave the impression of branching off from the main SSB community, which is a surprise.\n\nI think that's the main idea. If you want the community to come along, I think it's on you (not someone else) to: \n1. Regularly communicate in a transparent fashion that allows for discussion and dialogue before and during the decision-making process; and, \n2. As [@elavoie](@IgYpd+tCtXnlE2tYX/8rR2AGt+P8svC98WH3MdYAa8Y=.ed25519) has said, take on the burden of interoperability as changes are made going forward. \n\nYou appear to be doing the second, so the first should be fairly straightforward I think?

The Dev Summit community has been coming together for the better part of 2 decades to discuss how tech can accountably and sustainably serve social and racial justice efforts. New folks are always welcome, and our goal is to empower those who are early in their learning journeys and who don't necessarily self-identify as \"techies\".\n\nThe Dev Summit strives to avoid hyping and fetishizing tech, and instead focuses on conveying practical and essential processes for utilizing digital tools in sustainable ways. The event is designed to provide participants with best practices and insights they can apply in their day-to-day work. Conversation address the challenges, trade-offs, and opportunities we individually and collectively face in leveraging technology in our social justice and community work.\n\nYou will not see any presentations, panels or keynotes at the Dev Summit. The focus is on participant-driven dialogue and collaboration, and a primary objective is to enable participants to build and strengthen relationships where they can share knowledge and find support for many years to come.\n\n#### Help us co-create the agenda\n\nThe Dev Summit agenda is a diverse collection of discussions and interactive sessions that are developed in collaboration with confirmed participants.

Letter from the Author/Editor\nThanks for reading the first issue, everyone! Feel free to talk to me about it in the comments, DMs, or even by DMing my main account, [@romeo](@LrIL+UAvV+msJFiCxKZMJHCDASB8ekaSefbH8qdEwKI=.ed25519). If you want to help contribute, let me know! If you really want something in here but it doesn't fit under the general guidelines, I'll make a section like \"Community Submissions\" or similar. So don't be shy! On a more personal note, I've found the biggest challenge so far is trying to actually read what I scroll through instead of only skimming to see if it would belong in the SPS (Scuttlebutt Post Summary). It definitely takes a level of mindfulness to consume the content and make that decision simultaneously. Despite that, I think I'm doing well!

One of the most interesting developments in online music recently is the explosion of concert live-streams after COVID started. I’m actually doing some research on these for my graduate work, and the one thing people talk about all the time is how much they love the chat and how they view livestream chats as one of the only meaningful substitutes for the music-centric social life they can’t really participate in anymore. So, one way to think about he social flow is something as simple as someone sharing a track or playlist and people congregating to talk about it — probably which tracks they like, what it reminds them of, other things they like that are similar. So many social interactions happen in places where people gather for music, whether that’s conversations at concerts about movies and drama in the friend group, or the old forums on what.cd where people talked music and so much more.

You'll see this week, and in the future, a lot of \"Discussion continues...\" type posts. I figure as long as there's still new info being added, it's worth another click. And typically you'll be able to tell it's a repeat link by the \"Discussion continues\", if you don't want to see it again. This week's summary is about an hour late, oops.

I remember when I started noticing brands and shops announcing that they were serving 100% Arabica beans, it was in 2001. That is when I first learn that coffee could have different tastes and also the same year we started buying whole beans from a specialty coffee shop. I remember my parents driving to another city to buy the beans (about 50km). That E coffee really brought it all back to me, it was the kind of coffee they'd serve me out of a thermo after lunch in the restaurants we'd go as students. Not bad but definitely not what I'd choose to drink today.","mentions":[{"link":"@oW3ngfR0LsYHH45UHoWion1660/SM3Cs5YM50RUkz5w=.ed25519","name":"jaccarmac"}]},"signature":"IYCDWT7l2QyJCCgaGujobHlpfleJLimuAWBRqCmsSVtB1hibK0DTrzhC0Ycqs0mooKpgLJW6PEdX4LPiao/zBQ==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1602077986233,"rts":1601890134359},{"key":"%A93eyduOV+9nB9rYrPRc4raQVYEgXXR8F3sWI2PCoUk=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%xGQ9FA+u2AnNpGZP1nxv33K+xGec6BlQzTIKM8ZGSio=.sha256","sequence":3048,"author":"@0xkjAty6RSr5uhbAvi0rbVR2g9Bz+89qiKth48ECQBE=.ed25519","timestamp":1601904802456,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%YOIcXrgyxIWGbuqka6FgFGR5w9rF5NSiptG3PZsOoB4=.sha256","fork":"%gh6055rTYX8xaVk+AL8IHIQgsd0wGA6P1d3b6Qgru5w=.sha256","branch":"%YOIcXrgyxIWGbuqka6FgFGR5w9rF5NSiptG3PZsOoB4=.sha256","reply":{"%YOIcXrgyxIWGbuqka6FgFGR5w9rF5NSiptG3PZsOoB4=.sha256":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519"},"channel":"reading","recps":null,"text":"I haven't achieved that level of skill, I'm obsessing over Alecto and hunting for fanart.... \n\nI just want to drop that the author has an active [tumblr](https://tazmuir.tumblr.com/) and has posted the most amazing description of the characters in Harrow The Ninth:\n\n> I have also put in some new characters, but not TOO many!

I've seen a dramatic decrease in my average monthly expenditures, from about $2300 CAD when I started out to ~$950 CAD now. My goal is to keep it under $1000 CAD as a long-term average. \n\nThe monthly amount can vary a lot depending where I am. Before all this, I split my time between Albuquerque, Paris and Florianópolis Brazil, plus usually 3-4 months full-time traveling and a short stint in Canada to see family. In each of my three most-frequented cities I had free or very affordable housing (friends, artist collectives or generous patrons). But the costs can vary greatly month to month. E.G. for the first six months of the pandemic I was stuck in Vancouver, which is a much more expensive place than where I usually inhabit. Even with a gracious friend offering me half rent for the first four months and mostly free-camping for the second two, my monthly expenses averaged closer to $1400 CAD.\n\nThis amount doesn't include long-distance travel (train where I can, or by air) or some hard costs like cameras & computers as those costs are usually covered by the projects I work on.\n\nThis is a fascinating conversation. I find it very helpful when people share information like this.

Special section under art for inktober. I've heard the dude is trying to be a jerk about copyright and stuff but he can't catch me on here, so I will be calling it inktober as a catch-all for October month-long drawing challenges. Related, this is the first issue to have one of my posts in it!

Thought for a little bit about making a third account to follow everyone who could post something newsworthy. I've decided that this newsletter is not going to try to sum up the entire scuttleverse. This is heavily biased by my personal views and the people I choose to follow, and I'm okay with that. If you think I should put stuff in that I don't or vice versa, talk to me!

This is more than we’ve had at once yet. I’ve been trying to get out there and pollinate regularly. And our tomatoes are finally hitting their stride. I need to clean up the plant, but we have a lot of tomatoes just starting to show red. And I found a green potato in our groceries so I stuck it in water to let it develop some roots and moved it into a planter this week. We’ll see how it does. It’s in a planter with a tomato, which odd not supposed to be great, but I didn’t have anywhere else for it. \n\nMy neighbor brought me some kale and broccoli seeds that she thinks will thrive in CA’s winter, so I’m getting organized to start those. I don’t have a great place for starting plants in my cottage, but I want more vegetables. \n\nI didn’t photograph my last turnip but someone is eating my turnip greens, and I would kind of like them to stop.

This is how they used to serve me coffee in the little bakery/snack shops we had all over town. I don't remember there being so many shops like those anymore, they either became more fancy and now have inflated prices and cater for a more wealthy middle-class; or they closed down. \n\nBefore moving to the UK, there were five of such shops in a 5 blocks radius from my home. Four of those shops became the fancy version of old time bakeries, just one of them retains a bit of character from old times. I used to have breakfast &mdash; dark and strong filtered black coffee plus a buttered demi-baguette toast &mdash; multiple times a week. My city is smaller than Rio, and in those bakeries they did serve us ceramic mugs but, when I was still working in downtown Rio, with all the fast and crazy morning commuters that make Londoners feel lazy and peaceful, the bakeries couldn't serve us mugs. Clients would come and go too fast, it felt like a F1 pitstop: \"drink in two gulps, burn your throat, eat in two bites, choke, run to your job\". The solution was serving coffee using common glass, the kind that is equally used for coffee, beer, or cachaça (a large cachaça, not the tiny coward cup).\n\n![image.png](&9xG3RUOnjleytsiZnFuP62kOJ4hyPAlv8tBTveDVlMQ=.sha256)\n_those shops used to look like this._\n\n![image.png](&YahUKw/D4m2K8O/uodVh0tCchXcKHeExlqFCT0SOcQo=.sha256)\n_This is the one I used to have breakfast, they had a restoration and became fancier._\n\nRio and Niterói used to have so many cafés like that. They are not like coffee shops like we have here in the UK, they are an hybrid between coffee shops, bakeries, snack bar, pub, and restaurant. Do you want to have breakfast? Lunch? A beer? Buy a birthday cake? A cocktail? They serve it all. I miss those places.\n\nNow, for those that read this far, a bit of a treat. This is the prettiest coffee shop (actually they call themselves a confeitaria, which I guess makes them a _patisserie_) in Rio. It is called Confeitaria Colombo.\n\n![image.png](&YecHhnJBErS2mGg/OMP5KovUYTDi1BwadaLI+VbYS94=.sha256)\n  \n\n","mentions":[{"link":"&6B08oAsoA3e3x444hfWOR7F3BNCI5eawKx2yCg6NbXU=.sha256","name":"image.png","type":"image/png","size":2850862},{"link":"&9xG3RUOnjleytsiZnFuP62kOJ4hyPAlv8tBTveDVlMQ=.sha256","name":"image.png","type":"image/png","size":836475},{"link":"&YahUKw/D4m2K8O/uodVh0tCchXcKHeExlqFCT0SOcQo=.sha256","name":"image.png","type":"image/png","size":2536154},{"link":"&YecHhnJBErS2mGg/OMP5KovUYTDi1BwadaLI+VbYS94=.sha256","name":"image.png","type":"image/png","size":786991}]},"signature":"UxvbbFdoffOL6Zly/24vHZ8+g4tFotpaTvgztQfG9YPpyaQIZyIvK5zWsfCwnD3HEGzZwy9r1GTxOKA+KEiZBA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1604059174314,"rts":1604058696944},{"key":"%QMJRa7KuggjtVtVCtQ1Jeh6UF4F4S2GARIaW+7XlPec=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%UjFFAoMicloPnD0srWqHoZ07loVFRAj2ROxz/4SKCek=.sha256","sequence":3116,"author":"@0xkjAty6RSr5uhbAvi0rbVR2g9Bz+89qiKth48ECQBE=.ed25519","timestamp":1604059648961,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%qFAXrJpYElQulbT6dAfUoy1pU9fWn+1GgCPWBMYgZi0=.sha256","branch":"%L/kT+jJgYzcwpGbC2ivLaFhS49yY59bqwVJHtZop200=.sha256","reply":{"%qFAXrJpYElQulbT6dAfUoy1pU9fWn+1GgCPWBMYgZi0=.sha256":"@0xkjAty6RSr5uhbAvi0rbVR2g9Bz+89qiKth48ECQBE=.ed25519","%L/kT+jJgYzcwpGbC2ivLaFhS49yY59bqwVJHtZop200=.sha256":"@ujT9G7p4h1zeFiq7qX79eAQDyL2pTo0rLgIA7iA4VIY=.ed25519"},"channel":"showmeyourcoffee","recps":null,"text":"[@Alex](@ujT9G7p4h1zeFiq7qX79eAQDyL2pTo0rLgIA7iA4VIY=.ed25519) French presses changed how I drink coffee. Before having one, I'd always drink coffee in shops (I just posted about it in #showmeyourcoffee). It is not that I didn't had a coffee maker at home, or that I was not aware of French presses, for I remember them from some fuzzy memory of my youth. I think it is because my parents are espresso people, so I was not into coffee at home. It was when we got older and some of my friends started opening coffee shops, that I had my first real experience with different brewing methods and fell in love with the French press (and the clever, and the aeropress, and the v60...)\n\nBack in Niterói (my original city), you can go to a coffee shop, even a Starbucks, and order a French press. They'll just prepare it, and serve a tray with the cups and the press. We'd just sit there in a group of three or four and order a 1-liter French press. I was surprised that I can't do that here in London.\n\nThis led me to owning multiple presses (two at home; two at work), and having a bunch of gear here in the UK at home. I currently have two presses (a small and a large), an aeropress, and a v60. I'm still wondering if I should get a clever, I really liked them.\n\nI really believe that now that you own your own press and can experiment with coffee at home, that you'll enjoy coffee much more than you did.","mentions":[{"link":"@ujT9G7p4h1zeFiq7qX79eAQDyL2pTo0rLgIA7iA4VIY=.ed25519","name":"Alex"},{"link":"#showmeyourcoffee"}]},"signature":"rkncUYDWH/pCiaj8wNMI/GmSTUBAq0ps+K0GAKYhN8j8GJnsaMIy0urYN7dzHEDsJS/TYyUwRZGGFOrRCNo1DA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1604059651036,"rts":1604059648961},{"key":"%tHe8jugBzgHKC1oCOwC/OjOhA0jf+advemVt/COlw1Y=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%Nfsv53iz2UvsigAVaXczEm8S9iXYw541C1WllyvWdTs=.sha256","author":"@TpugRyODinGusTfOyYhVrz9rmNsR3K0F1jucrSZv0HI=.ed25519","sequence":206,"timestamp":1604030010875,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%8N/MU9rFjAnN9bhTwZwJK/euSEGThJTFw9x7SYx05z8=.sha256","branch":["%8N/MU9rFjAnN9bhTwZwJK/euSEGThJTFw9x7SYx05z8=.sha256"],"text":"The proposal that persuaded the Unicode consortium to add 🧶 (and 🧷 and 🧵) to the emoji character set."},"signature":"cCNl7tFcy7aceu7dGs5tmMw03NRS5IuDarvzVPQwjLztIKthNyLl+XF+i8aVf2jOjLAGvICFrL0qds5ePNA/Cw==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1604072012613,"rts":1604030010875},{"key":"%U3aAzJsFECOb+Yuv/cBwAKvyMKVBHwQZXoQNy7RAyEc=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%tHe8jugBzgHKC1oCOwC/OjOhA0jf+advemVt/COlw1Y=.sha256","author":"@TpugRyODinGusTfOyYhVrz9rmNsR3K0F1jucrSZv0HI=.ed25519","sequence":207,"timestamp":1604072522213,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","text":"Not the best photo but persimmons are here and I love it.

I'm refactoring to switch from _Bootstrap_ to _Tailwind CSS_. I'm much more comfortable with _Bootstrap_ and other toolkits that are similar to it, mostly because they take you by the hand and offer a ton of pre-made components. On the opposite end of the spectrum, _Tailwind CSS_ offers a ton of tooling and features but it is not big on pre-made components. Using it feels like going back to my days at the uni in the _Desktop Publishing_ class, and to be honest I like that. It will take me longer to build the UI but in the end I think the project will be better.\n\nI'm also refactoring the code.

Connected to the main monitor is my _Surface Pro X_ running _Windows 10_, I'm using it to work on #littlewebbypress. \n\nNext to the monitor is a _Thinkpad x230_ running [Haiku OS](https://haiku-os.org) which is my favourite Desktop operating system (that is still alive). On its screen you can glimpse at [QuiteRSS](https://quiterss.org/) which is a feed reader that was ported. It doesn't feel quite native, much like the other QT-based ports, but it is better to have ported software than not having any software. \n\nOn my really large _Thermo_ there is _less-than-a-liter_ of filtered black #coffee made with a _Hario v60_. I made a liter earlier today and I've been drinking it as I work. Later in the day I'll switch to tea or chai. \n\nThe confusion happening inside that pot next to the thinkpad is part of my collection of pens. I need a larger pot or another case to store the ones I don't use much. My _Sakura Gelly Rolls_ are not seeing much use and they occupy 2/3rds of that pot. On the photo you can see part of my favourite fountain pen, it is the _TWSBI Eco_, and you can see its bright yellow cap. Next to it and not able to actually fit in the tight cup is my latest pen, a _Pilot Prera_ with an Italic nib, I'm still not sure that as a left-handed human with terrible handwriting that I'll be able to use it effectively.

I mentioned in [this post about my working setup for the day](%NpR+1IauHXUZUrCFDIP1EHnT93J+BFQiPi997KmWNrM=.sha256) that I'm using a ported app to read feeds and that got me thinking about application development and Haiku.\n\nMany people here probably never experienced that amazing operating system. Many are only familiar with the big three &mdash; Windows, macOS, Linux &mdash; and never used a different system. I think some here might love Haiku and I recommend installing it in a VM and playing around, but that is not the main reason for this post.\n\nWhat I want to say is that is has become much easier to port software to Haiku now that is has a working Qt port. If you know your C++ and Qt, you can help port or develop apps for the system. For those that don't want to learn _Be API_ due to it being applicable just on a single niche operating system, Qt is a way to develop some FOSS apps that will benefit many systems.\n\nWhy not take Haiku for a spin? Why not play with developing for it? :D\n\n_PS: I'm considering making a video channel like the \"Serenity OS\" channel. I'd use that channel to stream me learning _Be API_ and building little apps.

You might have saw from my main that I took an extended absence unintentionally. I need to step back and chill. So these are some posts I liked that I've seen. It's not supposed to encompass the entire activity of the scuttleverse this week. I'll post this once it gets reasonably long. In practice it'll probably be a lot like past editions of SPS, just way less formal. There's still categories as you might notice, but there will not be tagged users because you can click on a thing and see the user. I'm also going to be doing a little more commentary and being a little less impartial.\n\n## Art\nOct 26: [boat!](%lVps/l/RkQdArMQyobpzcmz3U9D+rOwJaORZL23ClXQ=.sha256) Excited to keep following this boat's journey being repaired.\n\nNov 7: [samui goat](%3W67x3Lp1/wifuwoTg6EkRYxWdfD59QEvMeJbyPn5b0=.sha256). I like this painting, they're a friendly little dude with a very nice beard. Lawnmower in the background perhaps represents little goat having their job outsourced? Or maybe comradery among organic and mechanical workers.\n\nNov 7: really pretty [sunset](%4GXiUjqHpyT+8ZFk7C7vhZumXmggZqfZUEYRu88qig8=.sha256) from epk. I love pictures of the sky and clouds and such.\n\nNov 9: [album](%W0IzDX2QXn0wDODBsEDolOWO/SkJ4Tt40Kd1i9btNmE=.sha256) coming out soon, help wanted boosting the spotify algorithms\n\nNov 10: [sick art](%oUxZnRQQiLXgK1IOqDozrwd8axVgwfYDjClFBTq3yWw=.sha256) of microscope stuff run through edge detection. Looks like galaxies kind of. I went to one of Murilo's (OP) microscope virtual viewing sessions and it was awesome, 10/10 would recommend if they do it again. Update: [here](%Z0YJcHn/+P+KNA7ImgLHVIv46vM6GHl3sJdfElfcWec=.sha256)'s a gallery of microscope art!\n\nNov 10: [cool nature pics](%JEOmY9nFlelK469JTqgq//FAiGe/GkHGBBRsUOyPzh0=.sha256) - long thread, fair warning. All worth it though\n\nNov 11: [nice panorama](%IppRcnpMPon/ZNbFVUsACgFL1BH+wJuSDbf4K9/R+1c=.sha256) of California\n\n## Critters\nNov 8: really cool [lizard](%Z9an2KhxF2tDW8ift1/UoYy+A5rPBpbJkzw8Q5HydSA=.sha256) (iguanas are lizards right?), looks like a coloring book almost.\n\n## Tech\nNov 8: [update on earthstar](%6zB7uKmKcwP9/eVWWlBG1Rr0eDwuNOiHTRnKIRlPRNk=.sha256). I'm super hyped for earthstar. I'm not sure if it's part of ssb or separate, or whether it has a similar function, but it looks really cool and I'm psyched to try it out.\n\n## Goings-on\nNov 10: [info about NAIDOC week](%tG2By/UMpvzoIKGlhYjC2+7C42wpGYYaDz9QwzzjniY=.sha256) (Australia based celebration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people)\n\nNov 10: [BdA Festival](%bVLp+eHhS2METhsHK7dafovXPjYCxkm3WIGbajoBe0k=.sha256) - cool online festival, see post for more details + link\n\nNov 11: [reflection](%hplW+06mfu+t3lLwDpK4rDVso0lvKYScqtFRkaOvl5g=.sha256) on BLM protests. Thank you Rabble for sharing all your experiences - they're tough to read sometimes but I'm glad I know what's going on over there.\n\n## In case you missed it\nNov 5: [manyverse update](%wI44dVZD10F9ojnzYNngOBEF7J78IHHtt9OK109uJBM=.sha256). You can hear some people talking in the replies! It's super cool and exciting to have audio posts. I do think it'll be important to caption these verbal posts so everyone can see what's going on. I would be happy to do some community captioning but I'm not sure if it's socially acceptable to caption someone else's post\n\n## Misc\nNov 11: [really funny meme](%ggbYV89DvHh+vHjHFixTvkNFIgBONoHMB3lMwHxL/88=.sha256) coopted from nazis, tw in the thread for nazi mentions\n\n## Letter from the Editor/Author\nI'm back!

I used to have it on a weekly basis back in Niterói in a coffee shop owned by a friend who was really into brewing methods and variety. He constantly had at least five or six different beans available and had every single brewing method for you to order. Want an aeropress? a v60? clever? french press? espresso? you name it, they had it. Unfortunately, he closed his shop and went back to work with software development. \n\nAfter moving to the UK, I've been slowly assembling a collection of coffee stuff for my own home usage. With the pandemic, this collection expanded rapidly as the shops I would go daily are now either closed or just serving takeaways. I brought my french presses with me from Brazil, got a v60 last year. I was gifted both an aeropress and a mizudashi. All that was missing was something like the clever, something that combined immersion like you have in a french press with the clarity and dripper experience from a v60. I don't know how many times I've placed the clever on my shopping cart, just to leave it there. \n\nThats when I discovered something new. I saw a [video from James Hoffman showing the Hario Immersion Dripper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjIvN8mlK9Y). I noticed recently that I have been making more coffee with my v60 than with my french press, this dripper sounded like something I'd like.

I especially like the pool pictures, swimming pools give me a liminal space vibe and the colors are really good in these to enhance that feeling.\n\nNov 13: [cute little restaurant](%MBZoUVbs/CNS4ovLyQwz7a2lhCyxfa8iUA8GCN78UsE=.sha256). Roadside diner, I think - looks mysterious yet friendly, sort of a Gravity Falls vibe.\n\nNov 14: [amazing picture of a sunset (rise?)](%G8517mSGlwsql0D7qAbNJR90rHjW6Uem8DdOkNdUY3g=.sha256). We had sunsets like this a lot when I lived in the midwest US. I especially love a good late fall/winter sunset when the trees are just dark lines to give contrast. Very good colors in this, the dots of clouds almost look like if you zoomed in on a comic book style gradient.\n\nNov 14: [homemade step stool](%4+rNOsQfsTJ5QSod5LkstirtJAw+bEHTJdH8Dzqct/0=.sha256). Gridbeam is such a cool concept, I love seeing it in my timeline.\n\nNov 15: [frost pictures](%DVObS1cTXhuORs/xqCG/Ndkf3cNbJe1GQ+NFTFrPwok=.sha256). It's getting to be winter! I hope it gets this cold where I am soon.\n\nNov 16: [new album](%Jd4I5D/rgvNeq2qk6rG/vARHoBVvibqYZSAuNxBB0f8=.sha256)!

There aren't actually fish in there but it looks like a fish tank. I would be so into mycology if it weren't for the fact that I don't like mushrooms.\n\nNov 16: [mushrooms](%v8l9PT1nkEcI5ShkW/l+oFe7OmubKrh3XZmbIzJaLgw=.sha256).

I enjoy Spanish memes more, all other variables being equal, because of the extra effort in translating (I pretty much speak only English).

The kid took a ski lesson and a snowboard lesson and decided he prefers skiing, which definitely works for me. \n\nThe staff at the mountain regularly stopped people to say “you need a mask over your mouth and nose or we’re going to have to ask you to leave.” They still had to say it more than they should have, but for the most part people complied. \n\nMy husband learned to ski about when he learned to walk and I’ve never felt moved to catch up, but last winter I finally decided to take a lesson and when I wasn’t terrible at it, we planned another trip. And then COVID happened and it was spring before we had any kind of handle on what you can and can’t do safely.\n\nIn February we’re relocating to the mountains for six weeks, which I am looking forward to. \n\nIn other news online school is a train wreck and it is not working for these kids.

This was going to be for him to read in his own, but we’re reading it aloud instead. It definitely does a good job of telling the story of the relations between whites and Lakota from a Lakota perspective. He’s pretty into “Indian stuff” and had some beautiful dream catchers that he got “from a real Indian” while traveling in South Dakota. I wanted to start to introduce the idea that indigenous communities are diverse and also alive and present today (not just mythical historical figures) and to add some context to his ideas about US history. This was great for that. I think that they’re supposed to be covering Westward Expansion in history this year, and I really want to be able to talk about that from the perspective of the people whose land we we’re were expanding into as Europeans settled the American West.\n\n[Front Desk](https://www.worldcat.org/title/in-the-footsteps-of-crazy-horse/oclc/1004233118) (Kelly Yang) was a gift from a neighbor.

We actually watched My Neighbor Totoro. I forgot about that. He enjoyed it, but it’s not as riveting as Princess Mononoke. \n\nI usually rip DVDs so I can put my laptop in a good position to watch, without having to balance the external DVD drive. When we went to watch Mononoke the audio was somehow ~20 seconds off. So we watched Totoro because no one wanted to watch me troubleshoot our DVD set up. \n\nKiki’s Delivery Service is great, but it doesn’t have that “this is a such cool movie that I couldn’t have watched with a five year old” vibe.

I'm not going to keep someone out of the newsletter just because I don't like them, but I won't put in *content* I don't like. Subtle difference, I guess. Of course the exception is people who post actual hate speech or threats of violence, they won't get any content in here. Just so everyone knows what to expect. Hopefully you can get a nice break from the serious talk and poke through these posts. I think it's harder to focus on the nice calm stuff since with the nice stuff you give a like and that's it, it doesn't bump it on your friends' feeds or anything. Whereas the stuff that makes you mad you type out a whole response, which bumps it to the top of the feed and mind. Not sure what to do about it. Maybe more comments on the good stuff would be helpful? Stuff like \"I like this! thanks for sharing\" or similar. Maybe that would be considered clogging the feed though?

I have no interest in trying to implement the server in swift, I'd rather just bundle the _go-ssb_ server in the swift app and talk to it. What I'm aiming to do is a little Swift Package that exposes an ssb client. I'm basing it in my 33% understanding of _sbotc_ and hoping for the best.\n\nIf that annoys me too much, I will try to wrap the real _sbotc_ into a library I can call from swift, probably basing it in my #project-moon-hermit which already has parts of it working anyway.\n\nI think that fork I pushed has the necessary bits to implement a simple TCP-based SSB client library. Now, I don't know enough swift, crypto, or even SSB internals. But I'm very good at starting things and even better at not finishing them. I'd love if we could collaborate in building a simple client library, then we can either collaborate into a real client or just run wild each building their own Swift based client app. \n\nAt the moment, I don't really care about mobile at all, and am not worried about cross-platform. All I want is an SSB client that is a proper old-style MacOS application, by that I mean native UI, AppleScript Support, menus, that kind of stuff.\n\nThe server is too hard to implement, and we have perfect fine servers available for our use. :D I'm targetting the go server since that one is easier to bundle.

Safari Extensions.\n\nLet me just quote their docs:\n\n> ## Overview\n> \n> You deliver a Safari App Extension inside a macOS app. When a user runs your app for the first time, the app extension immediately becomes available in Safari. \n>\n> &mdash; _Source: [Building a Safari App Extension | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions/building_a_safari_app_extension)_\n\nYes, you read that correctly. To do a Safari Extension, you need to do a full macOS App and bundle the extension inside it. There is no such thing as a freestanding extension.\n\nThat is of course so that you need to go through notarization for your extension, and be able to distribute it through the mac app store. This way, Apple can veto your extension.\n\nIf we stop to do a _glass half-full_ moment and attempt to look at this mess as something positive, this could be an opportunity to make something like Patchfox a self-contained thing on the mac.\n\nSince an application is needed anyway, there is nothing preventing that application from being the ssb-server, or bundling a ssb-server with it. Ideally this could bundle go-ssb for both intel and arm64. It could use Safari's version of the [Native Messaging API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/messaging_between_the_app_and_javascript_in_a_safari_web_extension) to start the go-ssb server on demand. I just need to make Patchfox work with go-ssb. This might be a bit tricky but I believe it is doable.\n\nOf course that makes it very different than mainline Patchfox...

Why would we want to go back to client-server?\n\nWell, many users in the communities we live have such old devices that even ssb-browser might be a problem (we need to do more actual testing). Another thought we had was that it's better to encourage people to share buying single-board computers then better phones. The client-server architecture also gives the UX that most users expect to have.\n\nLike #cashless we've started exploring the #feedless way of running SSB completely on the server. [@rchaves](@VUgbo/ihmVWgh7szFJcG0Tg395T5/8JU0jijEVmyByU=.ed25519) created his own [publishAs](https://github.com/rogeriochaves/feedless/blob/master/web/lib/plugins/memory-identities.js#L35) method, which is completely different from [@Dominic's](@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519) [ssb-identities](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-identities). It consists of passing an id's secret to the function, which then uses `ssb.getLatest` to get a feed's \"latest state\" and uses it to `ssb.add` a new message to the database.\n\nI like this way as it keeps things simple, the db is kept safely on the pub machine. We can have different pubs following each other to create more data redundancy. This way we'll be using SSB more like a federation of pubs then p2p. But we're looking for a progressive experience where every type of device (including a Kindle) can participate, and as data-awareness happens a person can progress to having more responsibility over their data.\n\nBut feedless has gotten outdated, so I'd like to achieve something similar using ssb-db2 and ideally #ssb-crut as well. But when I tried migrating the publishAs method to ssb-db2 I got a warning stating that I shouldn't use `ssb.add` this way as it's risking a fork. Makes sense but... Is there a better way of achieving this?

I found out that I can control it using `netcat`, like this:\n```\necho -e '\\xA0\\x04\\x01\\xA5' | nc -q 1 10.147.244.91 8080\n```\n\nI can control each channel sending commands according to the table below:\n```\nOpen relay 1 :A0 01 01 A2\nClose relay 1 :A0 01 00 A1\n\nOpen relay 2 :A0 02 01 A3\nClose relay 2:A0 02 00 A2\n\nOpen relay 3 :A0 03 01 A4\nClose relay 3 :A0 03 00 A3\n\nOpen relay 4 :A0 04 01 A5\nClose relay 4 :A0 04 00 A4\n```\n\nSince the ESP connected to my home #librerouter, I can set crons on it to run at set times, taking advantage of the LRs GPS to make sure time is accurate. OpenWRT comes with timezone set to UTC. By checking the [documentation](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/system_configuration) I found out that we can set the right timezone by changing the `/etc/config/system`, file and checking [this table](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/blob/master/modules/luci-base/luasrc/sys/zoneinfo/tzdata.lua) to get the right timezone code (in my case `<-03>3`). I had to reboot for the changes to take effect, and now the `date +\"%T\"` gives me the right time.\n\nNow I can `crontab -e` and add the commands:\n\n```\n00 04 * * * echo -e '\\xA0\\x04\\x01\\xA5' | nc 10.147.244.91 8080                                                      \n25 04 * * * echo -e '\\xA0\\x04\\x00\\xA4' | nc 10.147.244.91 8080                                                      \n```\n\nSo this will turn channel 4 ON at 4:00am and turn it back OFF at 4:25am 🎉 💧 🌱 \n\nBut there's still one problem. The ESP keeps changing it's ip, and ideally I don't want to deal with firmware tweaking. So I had to write a little bash script to get the ESP ip from dhcp.leases and simplify the whole packet sending. Final version of the script can be found [on this gist](https://gist.github.com/luandro/181a7811967ef824f49f7e9106b7a427).\n\n Finally, this is how crontabs ended up looking like:\n```\n0 4 * * * control_irrigation.sh start 4                                                    \n25 4 * * * control_irrigation.sh stop 4                                                    \n```\n\nNow it's easy to add cron jobs for other channels 🥧 ","mentions":[{"link":"&iQwPyP1nm1ExSNL2bAhUg4kaxVwt4tQkY7ie9s7Tt1o=.sha256","name":"irrigation_esp.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","size":222022},{"link":"%jUHsj4gsDAWKIMz0fgFHKzzCTyDpING95mPr+baaYZY=.sha256"},{"link":"#librerouter"}]},"signature":"h9OmhDplXMwN/mPP1LuX10jEkfbFHCSwKoxtYpfZRYxqA3iFulLDO3jzePTDDsx1tNaABikZm5SJ9K7PjiCtBA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1627161525799,"rts":1627161525799},{"key":"%7K7Hdu2YIDaMgT/0J5tjdr6teekO9DHYBwbCsspB7sc=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%jww0pPCabtlmFJVLdsUDtSJyrEF+MbNPWmL/4mNPNrY=.sha256","sequence":978,"author":"@2NANnQVdsoqk0XPiJG2oMZqaEpTeoGrxOHJkLIqs7eY=.ed25519","timestamp":1628004845846,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","text":"We are looking for volunteers!

He learned how to configure the equipment and started moving the radios around. They were successful and were some of the few in the region to have Internet access in their homes. The neighbours soon learned of the feat and started asking for links to their homes as well. A community network was being born, and neighbours often get together for the heavy duty of maintaining the solar setup and communication equipment on the hard to access hilltops.\n\nAs me, [@Hiure](@TMz3wLnXWIEOWUoLiE0tnqT8JerD3TBFiCPyofN28K8=.ed25519), [@Nico Pace](@2AWm36HvcuOOcYeNgGgoybKXcMZx+COIf4/aAxJwnVI=.ed25519), [@markitos](@RmClT86x/o66QdW1dqAfj5Jek4qxUf8rtmvAlhZeZFg=.ed25519) and others know well from experiencing the day-to-day life in a community network, it's hard for neighbours to understand the difference between a community shared network and a private service provider. A lot of weight and dependency is put on top of the local technician, specially in cases where there's a single one, which eventually leads to burnout. So since early 2020, together with partners of the Kalunga, who were involved in the original setup, we started planning how to contribute in making the Kalunga Livre Network resilient and to imagine uses beyond the Internet, for community strengthening.\n\n![carro_rio_corrent_e.jpg](&PxCmgFH91mrB1VAv5pHz57H3L0TbPLcvFh1hQOC8Bro=.sha256)\n*My Fiat Uno car crossing a river in the Kalunga territory*\n\nThe first visit was suppose to have happened in August 2020, but that was exactly the peak of cases in the town of Cavalcante, and consequently in the Kalunga territory. So we were only able to visit for the first time mid-June 2021, after most Kalunga had already received their vaccines. Since we live so close to Cavalcante, about an hour and a half away from #moinho, me and [@isabela](@Gg1+3mvIraW9zkIEFCw13zy/yOLm4CFiZNZF2VDB4IE=.ed25519) went for a first visit. I was a bit afraid to drive my [Uno car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Uno), but the Kalunga assured me it'd make it. Jeová made the river crossings for me, as my only previous experience in crossing rivers resulted in hydraulic cast.\n\n![kalunga_luandro_torre_e.jpg](&Y5q46q2kF6bYIju2LT4Y40KCX37zHwGe0a1kStV9U0w=.sha256)\n*Me climbing a hilltop pole using Jeová's buriti bark & rope contraption: one of the scariest things I've ever done in my life*\n\nDuring this first visit me and Jeová were able to diagnose why the network was so slow despite the contracted 50Mb bandwidth from the provider in town. With a lot of help from the #coolab gang and a bit of tweaking on the Microtik radio's configurations we were able to raise the link's speed from 0.5Mb/s to around 20Mb/s and stabilise it. Some of the passwords to access radios and switches had been lost over time, so we had to climb both hilltops to reconfigure them through Ethernet. Also took the opportunity to do some equipment maintenance (one of the solar panels was wired to itself 🤔).\n\nThe result was amazing. A high bandwidth network, much better then what we have in Moinho, and full control of all the equipment. I did take a few Libre Router's, but it really didn't seem to fit the long range, star network topology.\n\nWith the technical parts figured out, I noticed all aspects of the network were centralised on Jeová (management, community organising, out-reach and tech). So the priority became to distribute responsibility and turn \"Jeová's network\" into \"Kalunga's network\". A challenging transition to make, that many #communitynetworks have been through.\n\nContinued...","mentions":[{"link":"&Nr98YeTIweOgO5u/kg5sfw0hAZaRcfYwOf/BBCqRHnc=.sha256","name":"kalunga_desenho_e.jpg"},{"link":"@j/eCgqDoTsp0SDzPYDNQh486qKYN9qu8Bzaye5foXQU=.ed25519","name":"befree"},{"link":"#rede-mocambos"},{"link":"#baobaxia"},{"link":"#kalunga"},{"link":"&v7juGdz1fXP/JXjmUhcux9G6DMk7gT/1MK66gMoOktw=.sha256","name":"kalunga_casa_jeova_e.jpg"},{"link":"@TMz3wLnXWIEOWUoLiE0tnqT8JerD3TBFiCPyofN28K8=.ed25519","name":"Hiure"},{"link":"@2AWm36HvcuOOcYeNgGgoybKXcMZx+COIf4/aAxJwnVI=.ed25519","name":"Nico Pace"},{"link":"@RmClT86x/o66QdW1dqAfj5Jek4qxUf8rtmvAlhZeZFg=.ed25519","name":"markitos"},{"link":"&PxCmgFH91mrB1VAv5pHz57H3L0TbPLcvFh1hQOC8Bro=.sha256","name":"carro_rio_corrent_e.jpg"},{"link":"#moinho"},{"link":"@Gg1+3mvIraW9zkIEFCw13zy/yOLm4CFiZNZF2VDB4IE=.ed25519","name":"isabela"},{"link":"&Y5q46q2kF6bYIju2LT4Y40KCX37zHwGe0a1kStV9U0w=.sha256","name":"kalunga_luandro_torre_e.jpg"},{"link":"#coolab"},{"link":"#communitynetworks"}]},"signature":"NTFnOmXAx+sEE57ijhy65oTA1eVBrvZrhW7eVG+jD7XFD9rh7EIfFgn/1w2GbLheW4NQQzOZJ5njBzioiYnuBg==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1629382540500,"rts":1629045320991},{"key":"%PK0BFrdYiTDGR965lUTdFCDSoVY+hGXrrC55c4PcPdg=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%Shfo3BK1K/YB4Wi2gHkQZywpFITyyC08IpSvV27xUlE=.sha256","sequence":8450,"author":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","timestamp":1629045443415,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%Shfo3BK1K/YB4Wi2gHkQZywpFITyyC08IpSvV27xUlE=.sha256","branch":"%Shfo3BK1K/YB4Wi2gHkQZywpFITyyC08IpSvV27xUlE=.sha256","reply":{"%Shfo3BK1K/YB4Wi2gHkQZywpFITyyC08IpSvV27xUlE=.sha256":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519"},"channel":null,"recps":null,"text":"# Gathering of Community Network Peers in Vão do Moleque 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 \n\n![kalunga_jeova_luandro_vince_hiure_e.jpg](&xUNCHND4cSkpmLppA0lPF+WKfpmV3FM8dJouVpQnzZg=.sha256)\n*[@befree](@j/eCgqDoTsp0SDzPYDNQh486qKYN9qu8Bzaye5foXQU=.ed25519), me, Jeová and [@Hiure](@TMz3wLnXWIEOWUoLiE0tnqT8JerD3TBFiCPyofN28K8=.ed25519) playing the guitar at Jeová's house*\n\nA second visit to the Kalunga territory was due, this time uniting peers from #coolab (me and [@Hiure](@TMz3wLnXWIEOWUoLiE0tnqT8JerD3TBFiCPyofN28K8=.ed25519)), #portalsemporteiras (Carol), #rede-moinho ([@isabela](@Gg1+3mvIraW9zkIEFCw13zy/yOLm4CFiZNZF2VDB4IE=.ed25519)), #rede-mocambos ([@befree](@j/eCgqDoTsp0SDzPYDNQh486qKYN9qu8Bzaye5foXQU=.ed25519) and his family), #mercado-sul (Julierme), and Georgia, who has been working with the Kalunga for a long time, was involved with the first setup and has also been the main organiser of this whole project, which has been funded by #apc. But due to me travelling for the [Tukano Project](%klnREUIw9FHajWCwzzVDwZJPjfhU9hQo2faE659b3/0=.sha256) soon, we had little time to organise this visit, and only about two weeks after we came back from the first visit, we were there again with the whole gang.\n\nThis time I was more confident about crossing the rivers, which resulted in me going to fast into the water and completely ruining my car's engine. Luckily we were just a few kilometres from Jeovás house, and Befree was able to tow my car. Had to leave it there, and still today we're figuring out what to do with it 😦\n\n![kalunga_mapa_planejamento_2.jpg](&5a4S6b5radA3O3x3vMjwVbmjWTySl4MIjFCuAQCMTO8=.sha256)\n*Jeová, [@befree](@j/eCgqDoTsp0SDzPYDNQh486qKYN9qu8Bzaye5foXQU=.ed25519), Carol and [@isabela](@Gg1+3mvIraW9zkIEFCw13zy/yOLm4CFiZNZF2VDB4IE=.ed25519) understanding and brainstorming on the Kalunga network through a drawn map*\n\nFrom the technical side, it was great to have befree and Hiure there to help out. We jammed a lot, both tech-wise and philosophically, about the concepts of the #community-server (which Rede Mocambos calls community data-centers or Mucuas) and #community-first user flows. We left a Pi 4 running some services and a portal, but due to the network setup we weren't able to figure out a way to make the apps available for everyone in the network. The most useful thing on the Pi was probably the [Zero-Tier](https://zerotier.com/) tunnel we left, so we're able to ssh into it and help debug the network if necessary.\n\nSSB can be very useful in their context, specially when Internet goes down, as neighbours live several kilometres from each other. But there are some challenges with how IPs have been setup, which make it difficult to have a pub or room accessible internally. We'll hopefully tackle that challenge with time.\n\n![kalunga_encontro_e.jpg](&C/NSsGDemzOlvPSZVG3JnuYTU/kccYczXtYNVEfY5Es=.sha256)\n*Community networks gang and Kalungas sharing experience at a gathering in the school*\n\nThe social part is the main bottleneck of the network, and Jeová was very reluctant to call a meeting, for whatever personal reasons he had. So we had to invite people ourselves in very short notice.\n\nNot many Kalungas showed up, but it was enough to start a conversation about the various aspects of the  current network and share the various experiences of other community networks which were represented there by us, in order to inspire ideas. Dulcimar, a Kalunga teacher, was very interested and active, and took into her own hands to organise the community to start the process of distributing responsibilities, following useful patterns that were shared by the members of the other CNs.\n\n![video:kalunga_retorno.webm](&bg3zkVgPH+Gdg3aay4wwH0gPlFKFRprkRbf13iCgPlI=.sha256)\n*Hiure, me, Isabela and Julierme riding to Cavalcante in the back of Befree's truck*\n\nThis second visit was very brief, but very effective, both for us, as it was a great opportunity to meet, catch up, share meals and joints, as well as for the Kalunga people, who had the opportunity to better understand the network (both technical and organisational parts) and start the process of really appropriating it in a communal way.\n\nI had a big loss, my car's engine, but it's part of my process of learning how to drive in rough terrains. Hopefully I learned the lesson: never go in to the water too fast!\n\nBut it was worth it, an amazing experience. Learned a lot from the Kalunga's, their way of life and resistance to maintain tradition. Hope to return soon, spend more time sharing their way of life and natural treasures, and collaborate to developing the network be become even more empowering for them.","mentions":[{"link":"&xUNCHND4cSkpmLppA0lPF+WKfpmV3FM8dJouVpQnzZg=.sha256","name":"kalunga_jeova_luandro_vince_hiure_e.jpg"},{"link":"@j/eCgqDoTsp0SDzPYDNQh486qKYN9qu8Bzaye5foXQU=.ed25519","name":"befree"},{"link":"@TMz3wLnXWIEOWUoLiE0tnqT8JerD3TBFiCPyofN28K8=.ed25519","name":"Hiure"},{"link":"#coolab"},{"link":"#portalsemporteiras"},{"link":"#rede-moinho"},{"link":"@Gg1+3mvIraW9zkIEFCw13zy/yOLm4CFiZNZF2VDB4IE=.ed25519","name":"isabela"},{"link":"#rede-mocambos"},{"link":"#mercado-sul"},{"link":"#apc"},{"link":"%klnREUIw9FHajWCwzzVDwZJPjfhU9hQo2faE659b3/0=.sha256","name":"Tukano Project"},{"link":"&5a4S6b5radA3O3x3vMjwVbmjWTySl4MIjFCuAQCMTO8=.sha256","name":"kalunga_mapa_planejamento_2.jpg"},{"link":"#community-server"},{"link":"#community-first"},{"link":"&C/NSsGDemzOlvPSZVG3JnuYTU/kccYczXtYNVEfY5Es=.sha256","name":"kalunga_encontro_e.jpg"},{"link":"&bg3zkVgPH+Gdg3aay4wwH0gPlFKFRprkRbf13iCgPlI=.sha256","name":"video:kalunga_retorno.webm"}]},"signature":"x4dhZsp25De8Nrt2Hupe2mVpEJnWB+Qfxv0Vgtalh89C7CmDz9u468t50xH2PccWZkGj2Qe6EfLfS+9g1nt8Cg==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1629382540506.003,"rts":1629045443415},{"key":"%SrHtOM61WEgTpK+3dnxLj/O3ZrBG8XGyM7lr1ZCVea4=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%PoprI/aqYLZ4o7rFYwhW2o3RqELOtZ6iARFG/nCE49s=.sha256","sequence":8457,"author":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","timestamp":1629122728891,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%xaTG1vpxPw/kzMMfnwCkPF1CZt1hmEfaq7HLZ0SWhSo=.sha256","branch":"%xaTG1vpxPw/kzMMfnwCkPF1CZt1hmEfaq7HLZ0SWhSo=.sha256","reply":{"%xaTG1vpxPw/kzMMfnwCkPF1CZt1hmEfaq7HLZ0SWhSo=.sha256":"@G98XybiXD/amO9S/UyBKnWTWZnSKYS3YVB/5osSRHvY=.ed25519"},"channel":null,"recps":null,"text":"This guy's low-tech is amazing.

Around the 70's families of different ethnic groups started migrating to this territory from close to the borders of Colombia and Venezuela seeking abundance. And they found it: fruits, fertile ground, timber, game and fish. The indigenous territory was officially recognised in 2013, but the title is shared with a national park, which is reason for lots of fighting.\n\nDifferent from many indigenous peoples in Abya Ayala, who use two clans (summer and winter, for example) as a strategy to maintain genetic diversity, Balaio is a patchwork of ethnic groups who inter-marry. One never marries another from the same ethnic group. But they use Tukano as the common tongue, although some of the youth are losing the ability to speak it, despite understanding it, favouring the coloniser tongue. They mix Tukano and Portuguese during gatherings.\n\nThe largest community, also called Balaio, has around 37 families and they are extremely organised. They've held assemblies early in the morning, which they call *Kiampira* (also the name of a traditional spicy fish soup) in the *Maloca* several times a week while I was there. There they share food and leaders, of all ages, take turns making relevant announcements and requests to all present. The topic of revitalising their language and cultural practices is very present and they've been putting lots of effort into it.\n\nThey are of the tradition of Ayuhuasca, although unfortunately I didn't have the luck to be part in any ritual.\n\n![balaio_frutas.jpg](&CZ/8KSTvwaHuxOLjMcjiNGihx4YL3HuohZ9uNU2/eOE=.sha256)\n*Bananas, cassava, cupuaçu, pineapple and cubius, gifted to me as a presents for Father's Day*\n\nBeing a lover of spicy food since I lived in South Korea, I absolutely loved their food. They have an abundance of fresh fish and cassava every day. They make cassava flour and also huge *[beijus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbeju)*, which are the main source of carbs. Chillies are consumed with almost every meal. And every once in a while a chicken or pig is killed, or someone is lucky while hunting in the forest: anta, paca, queixada pigs, deer, monkeys or many kinds of birds.\n\n![balaio_acai.jpg](&5WbV1KwHWwAwH1QM553seELvwRIx0R0b0gskrYyA+ng=.sha256)\n*Freshly collected açaí being prepared: hot water is poured over it, the fruits pounded until turned to \"wine\" (not fermented)*\n\nThey also have an abundance of fruit that they grow, such as pineapple (the one in the picture has been by far the most delicious pineapple I've ever tasted), citruses, cocoa, coconut, mango, bananas... They also collect many from the forest: açaí, bacaba, buriti, cupuaçu, tucumã, cubiu... When one fruit's season is coming to an end, another's season is starting. Despite the fact that most don't have any form of income, malnutrition simply doesn't exist here, the very opposite, these people are strong and really healthy.\n\n![balaio_rio.jpg](&nW/6jy2uxjCB8XKaL0tqNLBtJYWkoy9kUsz8CQjGVXs=.sha256)\n*In the amazon region, only huge rivers are actually called rivers, minor bodies of water such as this are called igarapês*\n\nThey bathe, wash their clothes and dishes in the close by *igarapê* several times a day and collect rain water from the roofs into big tanks for drinking and cooking. Different from the Krahô, they are very conservative about nudity, and everyone bathes with their clothes on.\n\nSimilar to the Krahô, 100% of people in the territory got Covid but none died from it. Everyone was cured through the use of their own traditional medicines. They're so confident about curing the virus that I heard a matriarch tell a university women to bring patients to the village instead of taking them to hospitals.\n\nThis has been by far the most abundance I've ever experienced in my life, and I'll miss it dearly. But of course, not all is perfect in the Balaio territory.

Naiara had previously told me that the army plays the role of the state here, but I didn't take it word-for-word. It became obvious as we drove from SGC to Balaio how literal that statement was. There are no police or government workers to be seen, almost everyone working on anything public is a soldier. And being the city with the most percentage of indigenous peoples in Brasil, most soldiers are indigenous (officials are always white though). SGC is also the only city in brasil where indigenous languages have been considered official languages.\n\nThe trip from SGC to the Balaio village, the furthest and largest village in the territory, was much faster then I'd expected. The ride in a 4x4 took only an hour and a half, but cost an absurd amount of money (for our standards), as much as the 30 hour boat trip from Manaus to SGC, around 100 USD. When the road was in worse shape, it cost three times as much.\n\nThe connection the communities have had with the army go back generations, and the current vice-president of brasil, General Mourão, was previously head of the military in the region. Because of this, Balaio has been the only Indigenous Territory president Bolsonaro has visited since he's taken office (maybe ever). He came for the inauguration of a bridge built by the military, which made the life of the peoples in the territory a hell of a lot easier. A [bizarre account of this visit has been shared](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3020996651555199) on the bastard's Facebook page. And because of this visit the roads have been fixed and the main village has gotten a government satellite Internet connection, the two things they've demanded the most over the years.\n\nBecause of this feat, they've gained the unwanted fame of being pro-Bolsonaro, which is very badly seen by any social movement, specially indigenous ones. But we can't really blame them for taking the opportunity, can we? It's as they say themselves:\n\n> It's not that we're pro-government. They use us, why can't we take the opportunity to use them?\n\n![video:balaio_aldeia_p.webm](&CEWgAOotpodJGZ0amww5IahFJLpdKg6ne9sARJtLoLQ=.sha256)\n\nWhen I arrived at the family's house where I was going to stay, the first thing I was asked by the matriarch was if I was an environmentalists. Environmental institutions are their biggest enemies, as [ICMBio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico_Mendes_Institute_for_Biodiversity_Conservation), for example, uses the authority they have over the park to limit the peoples use of their own natural resources. And the army is their biggest ally, as they provide all services the state should be providing. The default haircut of every male in the villages is military style, and most have served the armed forces at some point in their lives. \n\nThe elders tell stories of how Christianity was literately beaten into them many generations ago, yet they all consider themselves Catholics. I haven't seen them practice it in the Balaio village besides mass on Sunday, which started with a screening of some random american action movie 🤔 But there was another village where everyone was as Christian as you can get, singing songs and making prayers on every opportunity. Yet in a third village many were sunk into alcoholism, which makes favouring Christianity over your traditions worthwhile, if it means escaping the destruction that comes with addiction 🤕\n\nThe biggest shock for me was the presence of the army in the village. They were fixing up two old school buildings and an old community-centre to be used as their sleeping barracks and kitchen. A road which leads to the Colombian border passes through the territory, so it's a very strategic spot for the military. They'll be staying for at least a semester in the village while building bridges and fixing roads.\n\nThere are electricity poles coming all the way from town and are all over the village, but as they haven't been properly maintained, and vegetation in the amazon grows ferociously fast, all that infrastructure has crumbled and disabled for ages. The military runs diesel generators 24/7 to power their machines, fridges and sound systems. It's a terrible noise, but you get used to it after a while... At least they share the electricity with some of the villagers, but not all.\n\nI respect and agree with most of their demands, but not all, as some leaders are in favour of mining, poaching and logging. But after being a part of many of their assemblies I better understood the power-relations they've had with the military and missionaries for generations, and how those became their moral reference.\n\nDespite all these contradictions I've came to deeply admire these communities, their social organisation and resistance.\n","mentions":[{"link":"&GNC3ITVRYoSirTBzGA0cvuedwEujJ1J4Hhm82uRSz2Q=.sha256","name":"video:viagem_4x4_p.webm"},{"link":"&CEWgAOotpodJGZ0amww5IahFJLpdKg6ne9sARJtLoLQ=.sha256","name":"video:balaio_aldeia_p.webm"}]},"signature":"/rrG5lhNomL7or4cDRAB72pgi64+IyLLwSlBBPCDRuoaCBLl5MDbLJQVsxxI8dSikYw/IH2AOzrOSzuUpe3VAA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1629382540687.004,"rts":1629126599850},{"key":"%SGEioCmWJRWe+bMaBXPQhQ8md1ZxuSflUD9BvWvI1pk=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%EseB9DRebn+Pxtdiiicn5c0hKS7SyfujVT3D147pTsQ=.sha256","sequence":8464,"author":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","timestamp":1629141243132,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%YEl8sp1wBNFuguVKoMKWr2GSvZ0bI2xsYf3jf2qxLT8=.sha256","fork":"%xaTG1vpxPw/kzMMfnwCkPF1CZt1hmEfaq7HLZ0SWhSo=.sha256","branch":"%YEl8sp1wBNFuguVKoMKWr2GSvZ0bI2xsYf3jf2qxLT8=.sha256","reply":{"%YEl8sp1wBNFuguVKoMKWr2GSvZ0bI2xsYf3jf2qxLT8=.sha256":"@+UMKhpbzXAII+2/7ZlsgkJwIsxdfeFi36Z5Rk1gCfY0=.ed25519"},"channel":null,"recps":null,"text":"Seems like he's got his own distributed protocol going on lol\n\nBut yea, would be amazing to have him around.","mentions":[]},"signature":"AGvY5coN9joo8z7zAE8RvgnnA7BzVf/sDhgfW8nS2amsBgJQ+nhE4QP6qViWv4BDisYDJ5osZP92hjZ9nRcsDQ==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1629382540803.004,"rts":1629141243132},{"key":"%0VBSxlaDIcBNSoWQ2PGSXDdSfsCqwrU+S1Rqw2iDj1s=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%SGEioCmWJRWe+bMaBXPQhQ8md1ZxuSflUD9BvWvI1pk=.sha256","sequence":8465,"author":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","timestamp":1629146014835,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%xaTG1vpxPw/kzMMfnwCkPF1CZt1hmEfaq7HLZ0SWhSo=.sha256","branch":"%YBmZin+SJ0E0tguyoUqn+Ao1oGjTgI2eagOWWha7gjs=.sha256","reply":{"%xaTG1vpxPw/kzMMfnwCkPF1CZt1hmEfaq7HLZ0SWhSo=.sha256":"@G98XybiXD/amO9S/UyBKnWTWZnSKYS3YVB/5osSRHvY=.ed25519","%YBmZin+SJ0E0tguyoUqn+Ao1oGjTgI2eagOWWha7gjs=.sha256":"@G98XybiXD/amO9S/UyBKnWTWZnSKYS3YVB/5osSRHvY=.ed25519"},"channel":null,"recps":null,"text":"He had a phone on his waist all the time, which he powers using a power bank he carries around.

That’s exactly what civilization does, to nature, to nonhumans, to nature-based\nhumans, even to humans in other branches of civilization.\n\nWas pointed to this essay by [@maibits](@JaRaXuXCe6ujVINlr1+eu0p4rfLxgvtAPDjJJD9eX2o=.ed25519) who was reviewing a piece I'm writing, which heavily depends on a definition for civilization, but lacked one.\n\nWould love to hear critiques of this critique and get a conversation going. Beyond capitalism, state and colonisation, the very essence of civilization and it's myths of progress, science and religion are the lowest we've came too as a species. Acknowledging that is essential for understanding that there are alternatives and ways to live as part of nature.\n\n### Selected quotes related to tech\n\n> Our familiar “technologies” were developed in the context of conquest and central\ncontrol and runaway exploitation and the numbness to make it all tolerable. We have the ones\nwe have because they fed back into these habits, and they would continue to do so. Even if we\nhad cars powered by fusion plants, they would still daze us with their speed and enable us to\nlive far apart, when we need to slow to a walking pace to know nature, and live close together\nto know our neighbors. We need tools allied to sharing, not isolation, and energy sources that\ndo not require central administration, and energy in small enough quantities that we have to get\nour hands dirty and be intimate with what we’re doing.\n\n#myco:\n\n> A fungophobe is someone who fears all mushrooms, who assumes they’re\nall deadly poisonous and isn’t interested in learning about them. A fungophile is someone who\nis intensely interested in mushrooms, who reads about them, samples them, and learns which\nones are poisonous, which ones taste good, which ones are medicinal and for what, which ones\nare allied to which trees or plants or animals. This is precisely my attitude toward technology. I\nam a technophile!\n\n> Now, what would you call someone who runs through the woods indiscriminately eating every\nmushroom, because they believe “mushrooms are neutral,” so there are no bad ones and it’s OK to\nuse any of them as long as it’s for good uses like eating and not bad uses like conking someone\nover the head? You would call this person dangerously stupid. But this is almost the modern\nattitude toward “technology.” Actually it’s even worse. Because of the core values of civilization,\nthat conquest and control and forceful transformation are good, because civilization “grows” by\ndominating and exploiting and killing, and by numbing its members to the perspectives of their\nvictims, it has been choosing and developing the most poisonous technologies, and ignoring or\nexcluding tools allied to awareness, aliveness, and equal participation in power. It’s as if we’re\nin a world where the very definition of “mushroom” has been twisted to include little other than\ndeath caps and destroying angels and deadly galerinas, and we wonder why health care is so\nexpensive.\n\n#energy\n\n> What keeps all this going is energy — specifically, energy in excess of what we would have\nthrough living in balance with other life, eating and using our muscles. Energy is the pump for\nthe blow-up doll, or it’s the physical drug that feeds the mental drugs of detachment and control,\nwhich we crave in greater and greater quantities, leading us compulsively toward genocide and\necocide.\n\n> We need less of this kind of “technology,” not more. We need to get off our drug and come down\nbefore we kill everything that moves. The worst thing that could possibly happen to humans and\nthe Earth would be unlimited, free, clean energy. We would use it the way we have always used\nit, but more: to cut down filthy dangerous trees and replace them with clean safe artificial trees,\nto flatten useless mountains and put up engineered climbing rocks and ski slopes, to tame the\nweather into blue skies with puffy clouds that never rain, and don’t need to rain because we have\nrivers of Dasani™ circulated through pumps. We would turn the Earth into 200 million square\nmiles of Disneyland, with the few remaining wild animals in NatureDomes where every flea\nwould be computer-tagged. And when this system finally crashed, through sheer incompatibility\nwith the cosmos, nothing would survive bigger than bacteria","mentions":[{"link":"#anarchism"},{"link":"&O1EXrHG8F+Mghdv/3J0NgL9T+AgeRVRLpsl3XbnaZtk=.sha256","name":"Essay pdf","type":"application/pdf","size":94849},{"link":"@JaRaXuXCe6ujVINlr1+eu0p4rfLxgvtAPDjJJD9eX2o=.ed25519","name":"maibits"},{"link":"#myco:"},{"link":"#energy"}]},"signature":"WdDA+50PD95+agaCdvzhZMTBZvqP882NlR1F62RdTC/wc1e9EC7z804OxMbG0/q+tFWF3iOIrGMSa+v6IsSdDw==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1629382540896.002,"rts":1629292299475},{"key":"%Sqn2zKobwYCId5JpYL1Q0QPr1SRb2a9nJvp4N3uRnBE=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%tPxYYJlQ0PQ9OKalIXrMLWTpNYDMQXaM4FVnfokNRlI=.sha256","sequence":8481,"author":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","timestamp":1629292741630,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%tPxYYJlQ0PQ9OKalIXrMLWTpNYDMQXaM4FVnfokNRlI=.sha256","branch":"%tPxYYJlQ0PQ9OKalIXrMLWTpNYDMQXaM4FVnfokNRlI=.sha256","reply":{"%tPxYYJlQ0PQ9OKalIXrMLWTpNYDMQXaM4FVnfokNRlI=.sha256":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519"},"channel":"civilization","recps":null,"text":"Brings me back to %AoPzclrGeM7AqLW3nTqJPOZWVfA69/Ns/5MoT6T3KQs=.sha256","mentions":[{"link":"%AoPzclrGeM7AqLW3nTqJPOZWVfA69/Ns/5MoT6T3KQs=.sha256"}]},"signature":"3r8EqhbjsxhHhK71Qhk5QWiic95m7tMw8Gd/VTS8GUNE0RSslTnP3UKUSuNigrA4yBkemHB/G4s2SteenLghCA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1629382540902.003,"rts":1629292741630},{"key":"%NEadj7CX6pG3mJ66dln6ShAlSB6+Rf0U6EV3691wu54=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%sGJZaDU/TbgBptDznec2Vb3AUxgliiPeLx8etI2ZYOE=.sha256","sequence":8488,"author":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","timestamp":1629552008337,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%ubH6pbuxwFAWqFJRGBWqMCPKBfrlgqrLzq0wSe+0jFo=.sha256","fork":"%TJxBiTZWJD+eLTAbS48p56IZ5tHcn0deetNLxh3Stbs=.sha256","branch":"%IgU9txSRz9/EmKN/wRsAsWeGrjUnh3IP91YsJdMpoV4=.sha256","reply":{"%ubH6pbuxwFAWqFJRGBWqMCPKBfrlgqrLzq0wSe+0jFo=.sha256":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","%IgU9txSRz9/EmKN/wRsAsWeGrjUnh3IP91YsJdMpoV4=.sha256":"@G98XybiXD/amO9S/UyBKnWTWZnSKYS3YVB/5osSRHvY=.ed25519"},"channel":null,"recps":null,"text":"![felix_eu_p.jpg](&784XA0AFUjNmRjRBnustSUIr6kgyAVN+SOwhpsTh6SQ=.sha256)","mentions":[{"link":"&784XA0AFUjNmRjRBnustSUIr6kgyAVN+SOwhpsTh6SQ=.sha256","name":"felix_eu_p.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","size":324289}]},"signature":"s9FOcLi8BWoz/i0pq+wRXDKhq57+MYOZTBrDoQRaj9OOXW6Qq+iFzGlPCMlAyTKCgjyPjMJJTG81UQ/juHbiDg==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1629551769272,"rts":1629551769272},{"key":"%3Y+Qgay+Vpvi5vQsak3hQ0aLFWK8lBcc/TlZdVjWuw8=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%ziLTugtAAcp3PKK/weaph3up75C/glhK5O+6FrTTy9k=.sha256","author":"@mpPslpL5rJJDMPAIAWF6c0212h97ufSnw85ItfBt0pY=.ed25519","sequence":434,"timestamp":1630835271571,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%W2acwq7BqfXwt2yBipN5ccI2wgJOI5yNMcPY7hg/V/s=.sha256","branch":["%W2acwq7BqfXwt2yBipN5ccI2wgJOI5yNMcPY7hg/V/s=.sha256"],"text":"It’s been years since I read Cryptonomicon but it was, I think, the first Neal Stephenson book I read.

But the down side of using Docker to run the software stack is that it's put extra weight on the machine compared to native installs.\n\nInspired by the work #altermundi is doing with the [Miniserver](https://gitlab.com/librerouter/miniserver), which uses [Mender.io](https://mender.io/), we started researching BalenaOS:\n\n> Run Docker containers on embedded devices\n\nIt offers over-the-air (OTA) updates for all devices at the same time, has built-in VPN and has a big [list](https://www.balena.io/os/#download) of supported devices, with the possibility of adding new ones if needed. BalenaCloud's dashboard has amazing developer experience, but we can only have 10 devices on the free-tier, and additional ones are [really pricey](https://www.balena.io/pricing/).\n\nSo we've started exploring the open-source, self-hosted version, which is [Open Balena](https://www.balena.io/open). We've [setup](https://www.balena.io/open/docs/getting-started/) an instance on a dedicated VPS and we're testing it out. It doesn't have the beautiful dashboard, but has a nice [SDK](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-sdk) which makes it easy to build on top off.\n\nNico mentioned [Docker-slim](https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim), which can be used to minify Docker images, which we still have to explore and see if it fits with Balena.\n\n### Services\n\n![raspap.jpg](&4wjSjSpVrx0FQZTNfN8Pqoldsaavpy6XYhcSwI/fcXI=.sha256)\n\nBesides the portal and it's API, we're thinking on other useful/light services to run on the P2P Hotspot:\n\n- [Nginx proxy manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/): [Balena image](https://github.com/klutchell/balena-nginx-proxy-manager)\n- [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/): [Balena image](https://github.com/klutchell/balena-pihole)\n- [RaspAP](https://raspap.com/): [Docker image](httpshttps://github.com/RaspAP/raspap-docker)\n- [WiFi connect](https://github.com/balena-os/wifi-connect)\n- [WiFi repeater](https://github.com/balenalabs/wifi-repeater)\n\n## Devices 💻\nNico and Bruno have done lots of research on existing projects and devices on the market. We've started a [Spreadsheet](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/wDXyYBZOlWj-oaaZKG6dO-PE/) to compare different boards. WiFi capability is important as we're looking into developing an access-point device, so we'll also be testing some usb dongles.\n \nBoards we might be testing:\n- [Banana Pi M1+](https://aliexpress.com/item/32835268198.html)\n- [Banana Pi M2+](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005001365562037.html)\n- [ODroid-xu4](https://ameridroid.com/products/odroid-xu4)\n- [Banana Pi R2](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000113520641.html)\n\nWiFi dongles we might be testing:\n- [ALFA AWUS036ACH](https://www.amazon.com/ALFA-AWUS036ACH-%E3%80%90Type-C%E3%80%91-Long-Range-Dual-Band/dp/B08SJC78FH)\n- [Tplink TL-WN722N](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/usb-adapter/tl-wn722n/)\n\n## Community Portal 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦\n\n### Design\n\n![portal_comunitario_design.jpg](&E9OTmivY7S4Z7j3rlcvQVz+JXs8ksYpeiTEvGneYqNg=.sha256)\n\nWe've started on a [new design](https://www.figma.com/file/Emp9qCZQVGBlzKwSopDQlD/P2P-Portal?node-id=0%3A1) for the portal application. These are the feature's we're planning for the MVP:\n- map of neighbours and communities, to centre the experience around the physical territory\n- messenger-like ui and ux for familiarity\n- app-store that will link to external services hosted on local or remote machines, as well as to download mobile and desktop applications\n\n### Dev\nWe've started planning how communities will connect within itself and with other communities. For now basically thinking on having a `publishAs` api, which will also act as a promiscuous pub, following everyone on local network. The pub will be connected to an online room. This is a federated topology, not p2p, but it's good starting point.\n\nWe've updated the [portal's api](https://gitlab.com/coletivo-coolab/api-portal) to use #ssb-db2 and the native `publishAs` implementation.\n\nAlso added #go-ssb-room to [Coolab's Server](https://gitlab.com/coletivo-coolab/coolab-server/-/tree/master/room.coolab.org), which is live at: https://room.coolab.org/\n \nWe've been keeping a close eye on [Atek cloud](https://github.com/atek-cloud/atek) by [@paul](@hxGxqPrplLjRG2vtjQL87abX4QKqeLgCwQpS730nNwE=.ed25519). Seems there are lots of parallels to what we're trying to achieve.\n\n\n## LibreRouterOS integration 📡\n\n[@SAn](@1umPZGBb9uaBhA7DOCVQw1CIN0+Mn0ZKmtFvTv6B56c=.ed25519) rewrote #pirania, and we're working on the [integration with Lime App](https://github.com/libremesh/lime-app/pull/327). We're organising a hackday next Tuesday to continue working.

We've hit many bugs, which have been slowly being discussed with the Balena community through Git issues and the [forum](https://forums.balena.io/).\n\nWe found [configizer](https://github.com/balena-os/configizer), a really cool tool that can be used to batch update configurations of running devices in our fleet.

That led us to really invest in #balena.\n\nWe've also had the chance to test the first prototype for the [community-portal](https://gitlab.com/coletivo-coolab/portal-nuxt) with 3 of the communities on the field. We were able to adjust some code while on the ground and the experiences left many reflections around usability.\n\n![peti_dashboard.jpg](&z/GKr70/6wd1B3SjiSD8haw8fUvrL2GVPfKF0+2n4Yo=.sha256)\n\nWe've been running for a few days [Balena](https://balena.io) in production in devices on 6 different communities, which is showing us how well it really performs. So far we've only using well supported devices: Raspberry Pi 3 (running 64bits OS) and Rasp 4.\n\nWe've been running a proof-of-concept of p2p file sharing using [Resilio Sync](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/resilio-sync), which isn't ideal. But getting #cobox working with our Docker stack has been a challenge. Help is welcome.\n\n> (2) What turned out more complicated than expected?\n\nGetting our team together has probably been the biggest challenge, as we're constantly travelling and Nico is starting his parenthood. But being physically together with Hiure and Tania for the past month really helped to  move things forward.\n\nThere have been many similar projects to learn and to be inspired by. The research to understand previous experiences went on for longer then we expected, but gave us lots of insights on best paths to trail.\n\nWe're still deciding on the ideal user-flow for the portal, while also being realistic about building an SSB client from scratch.\n\nBalena has some indispensable features, but learning it's tweaks has been a challenge which makes us move a bit slower then with pure Docker stacks we've gotten used too. But it'll pay out in the end, not just for the features, but hopefully better performance with low-end devices.\n\n\n> (3) In which state is the project currently?\n\nVery start. [@brunovianna](@YsnnRN1dtoqyXf9/LZttSRcS5YS6iGpexwgrSTFk32E=.ed25519)  started buying the boards and doing initial tests with Balena.\n\nMe, [@Hiure](@TMz3wLnXWIEOWUoLiE0tnqT8JerD3TBFiCPyofN28K8=.ed25519) and Tania have been working on the software stack using Docker and Balena.\n\nAfter experimenting a lot with the community media server, [Jurubeba](https://gitlab.com/coletivo-coolab/jurebaba), and the community internet sentry, [Guarita](https://gitlab.com/coletivo-coolab/guarita), and also running them in production, we're confident enough with Balena to start dealing with greater challenges that come with P2P Access Point, such as working with less supported boards like the Banana Pi M1+.\n\n> (4) If the project were to be extended, what would be the next steps?\n\nWe don't intend to ask for another grant for this project, as we're just starting off. So we expect to keep on working on our team's rhythm for the next months.\n\nI believe some of the next steps are:\n\n1. Decide on software stack and get it running\n1. Decide on community portal design and architecture\n1. Develop community portal \n1. Work on user documentation\n1. Release and give support\n\n> (5) What could be done to improve the funding process?\n\nResonate with [@andrestaltz](@QlCTpvY7p9ty2yOFrv1WU1AE88aoQc4Y7wYal7PFc+w=.ed25519).\n\nI think the process has been great, and think the funds have been (will be, in our case) put to good use in all projects.

But even while travelling I spent sleepless nights in hotel rooms downloading and preparing the devices.\n\nMy initial idea was to boot the Pis from the SSDs connected to USB 3. But after a lot of trial and error I found out that having an SSD connected to USB 3 and a Wifi access-point at the same time is impossible for the Pi, because of [RF interference](https://www.indilib.org/forum/general/6576-pi4-usb3-and-wireless-2-4ghz-interference.html), which is detailed in [this paper](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/io/universal-serial-bus/usb3-frequency-interference-paper.html).\n\n![ap_server_movel.jpg](&IR9JyQ0Vn1310LbLiVFgvub25c9vkiwTuyhXfUJAwK4=.sha256)\n*Mobile community-server hotspot: a Raspberry 4, connected to UPS with two 18650 batteries and an external SSD*\n\n\nIn the territory, the process for implementing the #community-server began by having assemblies which were held specifically for the purpose of our project. During these gatherings I'd turn on the mobile hotspot-server to demo to everyone present what a community Intranet is, in order to settle expectations and misunderstandings, and also get some early feedback.\n\nSome of the feedback was really useful, and so I had to do a lot of improvising at the Balaio village despite it's very precarious Internet connection, to tweak some services and add some new ones.\n\n![balaio_instalacao_solar_parintins.jpg](&maSR4ozSNmVO6aeiHTFdDzv6REWplZjakMKOeRROah0=.sha256)\n*Solar panel being installed on roof of a school at Parintins village*\n\nFirst thing we needed was the energy to power our Intranet, so on each of the 3 villages we started by installing the solar kits we brought: 150W panel, with 150Ah battery and cheapest 10A controller.\n\nUsing such a low-end controller was probably not the best idea, as one malfunctioned within a week. Not sure how the rest is holding out.\n\n![balaio_bateria_controlador.jpg](&ewCfX7eWWaCWo0NTjjRD+mXDtAbz6ZdIZkiHbCUNDb8=.sha256)\n*150Ah battery and cheap 10A controller*\n\nTo power the community-server we used [12V to 5V 5A converters](https://www.fabioconversoresdc.com/automotivos/conversor-dcdc-9v-12v-24v-36v-para-5v-5a-au22) between the 12V battery and the Pi's USB C cable.\n\n![balaio_jovens_codigo.jpg](&SkJJtdM9T52R5n2AEAeBI79nPBA5BeDd6aZV10XIgVA=.sha256)\n*Young Balaio men gathered around a laptop playing with the community-portal's code*\n\nI had *ISO* images of the [servidor-comunitario](https://gitlab.com/coletivo-coolab/servidor-comunitario) stack on my computer. So burning the SD card and putting it on the Pi produced a configured hotspot and dnsmasq, with stack of applications:  Jellyfin, Calibre, Meshtastic Web, Solar Calculator, Filebrowser, Etherpad.\n\nWe had the first prototype of the [community-portal](%NCNj6nsTgbOR5Q/7GT6qruVqijkPOwtTd4U95BmDCsA=.sha256) which is edited through a [code-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/code-server) and has offline maps with pre-downloaded tiles, [native-land](https://native-land.ca/), their territory's geojson shapes and markers for each village.\n\n![balaio_cartaz_intranet.jpg](&BUDhTWGZ2biUmavIzkrN8z8c7IfQDevCR1AoVZgvTMc=.sha256)\n*Poster with instruction on how to connect and interact with the community-server and portal*\n\nTogether with representatives from each village we created posters with instructions on how to connect to the community intranet and make use of it's applications and services.\n\n![balaio_roteador_servidor.jpg](&pAo0Ogf+tyafjOr7HYsYaWKjfhNleBCUk6IvP2Fwz54=.sha256)\n*Final setup: Pi4 in a waterproof enclosure and Tplink Archer C50 with #libremesh*\n\nUsing the Pi as a community hotspot is far from ideal, as it's wifi isn't really made for that. So two of the three villages also got a router running LibreRouterOS, which made it possible for the signal to go much further, and enables the network to be expanded through mesh in the future.\n\nAnother advantage is that since we're not using the Pi as a hotspot, USB 3 works fine again, giving the intranet a huge boost in performance.\n\nSomething we learned was that the Pi4 can't remain completely sealed in a waterproof enclosure in the Amazon. Too hot, despite it's dual fan heat-sink armor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLast year we experimented with the community-server and community-portal with indigenous communities for the first time at the [Krahô territory](%cFBwesb+eIIVMd6vF8jptiklEr9lyWENl9e/k2tMikY=.sha256). This was the second experiment, and I believe we were able to take it to a whole new level.\n\nBut we were still not able to have the community fully appropriate this technology, but we're getting closer and we really learned A LOT.\n\nThis experiences has been really valuable for us to understand the importance of creating cohesion between services, having monitoring of the servers and on how to make a better portal experience for communities. Since then we've evolved a lot with our newer community-server stacks based on [Balena](https://balena.io), such as [Jurubeba](https://gitlab.com/coletivo-coolab/jurebaba) and [Guarita](https://gitlab.com/coletivo-coolab/guarita).","mentions":[{"link":"&DVf8L40vWTuzvFLfYlBoowic1o8VMLTsHvnA/YvJV10=.sha256","name":"balaio_equip_3rasps.jpg"},{"link":"&IR9JyQ0Vn1310LbLiVFgvub25c9vkiwTuyhXfUJAwK4=.sha256","name":"ap_server_movel.jpg"},{"link":"#community-server"},{"link":"&maSR4ozSNmVO6aeiHTFdDzv6REWplZjakMKOeRROah0=.sha256","name":"balaio_instalacao_solar_parintins.jpg"},{"link":"&ewCfX7eWWaCWo0NTjjRD+mXDtAbz6ZdIZkiHbCUNDb8=.sha256","name":"balaio_bateria_controlador.jpg"},{"link":"&SkJJtdM9T52R5n2AEAeBI79nPBA5BeDd6aZV10XIgVA=.sha256","name":"balaio_jovens_codigo.jpg"},{"link":"%NCNj6nsTgbOR5Q/7GT6qruVqijkPOwtTd4U95BmDCsA=.sha256","name":"community-portal"},{"link":"&BUDhTWGZ2biUmavIzkrN8z8c7IfQDevCR1AoVZgvTMc=.sha256","name":"balaio_cartaz_intranet.jpg"},{"link":"&pAo0Ogf+tyafjOr7HYsYaWKjfhNleBCUk6IvP2Fwz54=.sha256","name":"balaio_roteador_servidor.jpg"},{"link":"#libremesh"},{"link":"%cFBwesb+eIIVMd6vF8jptiklEr9lyWENl9e/k2tMikY=.sha256","name":"Krahô territory"}]},"signature":"jfXrJSvPH/jJVImay5IG0LMgsHRtv6DwOBj2fLwNlyKeMpMqp+HzPa6OSpnBT8OFB24w2vFMW2hUTUeggOcABg==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1636072267474,"rts":1636071362649},{"key":"%hU6TlCwucDHPv9kUS+mU8oYfMm8GaZV/M/AWjljLT1w=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%Xe6f9gYN5nnWuOdlX43q9Blh+YtHrly13m8nP0oZQfU=.sha256","sequence":8677,"author":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","timestamp":1636284079122,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%tq9PSe6/q5109Qjx46jH2kvkhiDuqOpZja0itoMNV4k=.sha256","branch":"%zB9OL94UVOacnlvxGTuQfhMVTGpNG6nnalPpJE6bfCI=.sha256","reply":{"%tq9PSe6/q5109Qjx46jH2kvkhiDuqOpZja0itoMNV4k=.sha256":"@Sur8RwcDh6kBjub8pLZpHNWDfuuRpYVyCHrVo+TdA/4=.ed25519","%zB9OL94UVOacnlvxGTuQfhMVTGpNG6nnalPpJE6bfCI=.sha256":"@3wl2IivU+ghWlZj4psiRMQlcOKV9iLbXbNIb1wv+0/M=.ed25519"},"channel":"books","recps":null,"text":"Thanks for this!

Unforunately it's not SSB related, yet...\n\n![eu_tani.jpg](&EO3DHdU4inmfijKNWoaUcoRqEueVBCJyl6E2VN8g1pU=.sha256)\n*Me and Tania talking in the Guarani prayer house of Krukutu village*\n\nIn our first visit, in the beginning of October, an assembly was organised for the purpose of debating digital technologies. Many Guarani leaders and youth took part. The elders were quite active, the youth never cared to share a word on the subject.\n\nThe biggest problem mothers and fathers were having, was that their children were staying till late playing the infamous mobile game, [Free Fire](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dts.freefireth&hl=en_US&gl=US). I can relate, I've been a game addict with Warcraft II and III over my infancy and teens. But mobile gaming is very different, as it's become handheld and very accessible:\n\n> [Free Fire] prioritizes performance, making it a great choice for any type of device\n*[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garena_Free_Fire)*\n\nAnother big problem. The Guarani have traditional gatherings every day at 6pm. Even adults were starting to miss on the communal gatherings because they were stuck on their phones, most probably on streaming platforms or social media.\n\nTheir first reaction to \"The Internet Problem\": **BLOCK IT ❗**\n\nWe believe in trying the social solution before going to tech. But it seems they've tried and haven't succeeded in controlling Internet access. It's not the first I've seen indigenous peoples come up with extreme solutions for extreme problems. The Krahô from Pedra Branca village, for example, had to build a reinforced jail and maintain a community police force to deal with alcoholism.\n\n### Firewall 🔥\n\n![muro_guarani.jpg](&41qi4vZaGdReDvgblE/3jR+oDgVb3TASSNigGXIjf+Y=.sha256)\n*Wall in the Kalipety village with paintings representing the Mybia Guarani peoples*\n\nThe task given to us was:\n- Messaging apps (Whatsapp, Telegram, Signal) should be left open at all times\n- Certain devices should have access to everything at all times\n- Each village needs a way to have their own schedules for blocking access\n- Don't let VPNs pass\n\nThe project reached me personally because of #pirania, the mesh captive-portal solution, which solves all problems besides the first (whitelisting messangers).\n\nBut a couple of moths agos Pirania was far from ready. So we started with DNS blocking, using #raspberrypi 3+, [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and [Balena](https://github.com/klutchell/balena-pihole). Tania, our official namer of things, called it: [Guarita](https://gitlab.com/coletivo-coolab/guarita)\n\nYou can easily get started with your own Guarita by following instructions from [Balena hub](https://hub.balena.io/coolab/peti).\n\nIt works with a simple cronjob and shell script that enables to schedule DNS blocking. And through Pihole's great interface we're able to set the whitelist for messaging app's domains and put devices into groups which don't get blocked.\n\nBut then we hit the problem that all tyrannic rulers hit: **VPNs**.\n\nContinued...

Took me a while to realise that. And so we arrive at %5WJlg+7zpW9dve4xqvmxiV8Pa3XVA0CpwjzEIR5FMq4=.sha256\n\nWe figured that we might actually need another Ethernet on the Rasp to achieve what we need. And we'd still need to write the firewall rules from scratch and create an interface for adding whitelisted devices. Quite a large undertaking, which could takes months, and still not guaranteed to work.\n\nWe spent several days during the last month reviewing Pirania's new API, rewritten by [@SAn](@1umPZGBb9uaBhA7DOCVQw1CIN0+Mn0ZKmtFvTv6B56c=.ed25519), and creating the Lime-App interface. Both the [new API](https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/893) and the [new front-end](https://github.com/libremesh/lime-app/pull/329) are being reviewed as a PR. Hopefully they'll be out on the next [LibreRouterOS release](https://gitlab.com/librerouter/librerouteros/-/releases).\n \nWe tested bypassing with the [RiseUp VPN for Android](https://riseup.net/en/vpn) and Pirania successfully blocked it, which makes sense. The only problem with adding Pirania is that we'd need #openwrt compatible routers, and the project has a limited budget for equipment.\n \nAll the 21 villages have a satellite internet connection, which came with [DLink DIR 819](https://in.dlink.com/en/products/dir-819-wireless-ac750-dual-band-router) routers. There's no official firmware for it, but we found a [repo for it](https://github.com/Sirherobrine23/Openwrt-DIR-819). We decided to take the risk and flash it.\n\nWe created a nice plastic brick, with flashing LEDs. We weren't able to recover the bricked router :(\n\n### Path forward 🚲 \n\n![aldeia_kalipety.jpg](&bJ3TAK3XAh6fUDaZKVlGIYrHsIfDgQF04/Zx21Vf7h4=.sha256)\n*Typical wooden house in Kalipety village. Spaces around the houses are convered in agroforests*\n\nThe safest path forward seems to be using appropriate LibreRouterOS routers, which are readily available and not that expensive to get. The challenge now is whitelisting Whatsapp ips, which aren't publicly available and very dynamic:\n\n> *Unfortunately, we [WhatsApp] are not able to share any IP pools manually since now on as they are dynamically generated per partner. [Source](https://www.whatsapp.com/cidr.txt)*\n\nWe're researching together with the #libremesh team on ways to achieve this with Dnsmasq and ipset.\n\nWe already bought the 21 Raspberry Pis, which we're using to create an easily hackable block. They'll be great for creating a better Internet experience by filtering junk and caching DNS for faster loads. We're also adding [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), [Filebrowser](https://filebrowser.org/) and [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/) so that when blocks are active, people can still access cultural content which will be curated by community leaders.\n\nThis Guarani intranet might be where SSB might fit in the future, as they advance on understanding the perils of corporate digital territories and realise that alternatives exist. It's where we want to get with **Connecting Peoples of the Earth**, have a secure digital space where indigenous peoples can exchange stories and strategies of resistance.\n","mentions":[{"link":"&kDWtxt4AFifIPo2hRaQx8jxaDO11b/y+FQevZ12mPfA=.sha256","name":"rasps_guarani.jpeg"},{"link":"%5WJlg+7zpW9dve4xqvmxiV8Pa3XVA0CpwjzEIR5FMq4=.sha256"},{"link":"@1umPZGBb9uaBhA7DOCVQw1CIN0+Mn0ZKmtFvTv6B56c=.ed25519","name":"SAn"},{"link":"#openwrt"},{"link":"&bJ3TAK3XAh6fUDaZKVlGIYrHsIfDgQF04/Zx21Vf7h4=.sha256","name":"aldeia_kalipety.jpg"},{"link":"#libremesh"}]},"signature":"tk5zFTo5mJSWZxHCtGbFz9WN5hFN9su6zPUGDJfwTiR2og7cJ7neQrcBrg4fNqxqfLVQiBU5bj5JrVffhNNLDQ==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1638281822137,"rts":1638281822137},{"key":"%RKAZGiJKn1Ha2lcGLoV+DG+SVrFTN6osIccRBEosn0s=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%0kpnzD45QhJG5UgvQkbFuObttasaN8FrNpHtQrG5v20=.sha256","sequence":8784,"author":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","timestamp":1638793072415,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%/p6DjTmH+Ixfwy0wLCLHwIHoO4GxJCKsnogR1VbYtjI=.sha256","branch":"%mPEjyVOZ58fIxEE36ghOzQsrihNtpnEOmR+8GgRSZME=.sha256","reply":{"%/p6DjTmH+Ixfwy0wLCLHwIHoO4GxJCKsnogR1VbYtjI=.sha256":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","%mPEjyVOZ58fIxEE36ghOzQsrihNtpnEOmR+8GgRSZME=.sha256":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519"},"channel":"monitoramento","recps":null,"text":"##

I asked the elders to draw a map of their territory, and did a beautiful job at it.\n\n![balaio_mapa.jpg](&+KRydgirpb2UUKWW3t2SVSJapV/mrfH0xcbnOcugaPA=.sha256)\n*Balaio map with sticky notes symbolising LoRa mesh nodes*\n\nTo my surprise the [original plan](%klnREUIw9FHajWCwzzVDwZJPjfhU9hQo2faE659b3/0=.sha256) for the Lora network was targeting the wrong village. It turns out the Balaio village was 13Km away from the hilltop, much further then expected.\n\nThe hill at the middle of the territory is called *Morro dos Seis Lagos* (Six Lakes Hill) and it's theoretically a national park under the control of [ICMBio](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Chico_Mendes_de_Conserva%C3%A7%C3%A3o_da_Biodiversidade). So the plan for my visit was to install the community-servers and show how the LoRa network works so that the communities could ask for permission to install a node at the hilltop.\n\nWhen the villagers realised how simple a LoRa node is and the huge positive impact it could bring, they decided we should just go for it even without any approval.\n\n![balaio_abrindo_caminho.jpg](&NcajqtfUvYY0TCRzvgiF0/3U8yptdOAvQLpWEnScLK8=.sha256)\n*Young Balaio men opening up the river path with a chainsaw*\n\nTogether with some of the youth who had experience hiking the hill we came up with a plan on where and how to place the LoRa node. Each of the 3 villages that were benefiting from the project sent representatives. Me and the boys from Balaio and Ya Mirim villages went by boat, while the guys from Parintins went by foot cutting thru the forest and met us at the base of the hill.\n\nSince we weren't prepared for the installation, I had to recover an old solar panel. It was large and heavy, but would hopefully produce enough energy to keep the radio alive.\n\nOur guides got a bit lost and we miscalculated the trail, so we walked in circles for an additional 3 hours in the jungle, and that's when the huge panel proved to be a big hassle.\n\nBut we finally managed to find a good campsite and the highest part of highest hill in the territory. Turns out none of them had been there before, and they weren't aware of anyone who had. Felt like true explorers.\n\n![balaio_no_territorio.jpg](&gfvEEc6VwcMN5tWclo+6HqYkOPqMxiNCRHIzcP9u0EY=.sha256)\n*Balaio men at the top of the tree fixing the solar panel and LoRa node*\n\nThe guys from Parintins weren't prepared for camping, so they left at nightfall. Can't imagine them cutting back thru the jungle at night, but they made it back safely. We camped next to a beautiful lake, ate some of the dried fish and cassava flour we had and told stories of some of the mythical creatures of the forest. We slept in our hammocks and I confess being a bit afraid of the jaguars, but soon fell asleep.\n\nWe went back to the highest spot early morning. They cut the branches of the highest tree and fixed the panel. They fixed the Lora node to a wooden pole and fixed the pole to the tree as well, so it stood higher then any tree.\n\nVery quickly we were able to get signal from the most distant village 13Km away, so the mission was a success 🎉\n\n![balaio_herois_lora.jpg](&BLvDxU93dcpAzAJRlc0cqBY4Yn+74w/EjLtWlDeq0QU=.sha256)\n*Our party of explorers right before descending the hill*\n\nWe had nothing left to eat besides cassava flour, which they put in water. They call that *Chibé*. Not very delicious, but enough to give us energy for the trip back.\n\n![balaio_lora_rio.jpg](&aJQoySwH0YHsJo3FUdm1dLLj2DCfim1PF1QGQ/nilw0=.sha256)\n *Checking for LoRa singal on way back thru the river*\n\nThe ride back was pretty smooth and all we talked about was food. Wasn't able to signal from the hill node as there was huge blind-spot until very close to the village.\n\nWhen we arrived, an angry Yanomami came to recover the boat. Turns out the boat we had taken wasn't from anyone they knew. Despite him looking really angry, it seems they have good relations and nothing happened.\n\nThe noodles with chicken we had afterwards was one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life.\n\n![cobertura_mensagem_lora.jpg](&g9BdKVdNxmli3Egfv1FuGlPNVk9N/0ougv8hlkw1IBg=.sha256)\n*LoRa 915Mhz network coverage simulation made with [RadioMobile](https://www.ve2dbe.com) with the villages to be connected and the first Meshtastic message between villages*\n\nThe simulation which I only ran after the visit shows that the Balaio village isn't so great for reception. But we manged to establish communication between the villages. The moment me and Adelina were able to exchange message we felt we accomplished something very important.\n\nI had taken only 5 Lora nodes and unfortunately one of them malfunctioned. I had to take the node from the Balaio village down from the roof so that it could be used with a phone. Despite the community-servers running [Meshtastic-web](https://github.com/meshtastic/meshtastic-web/), it wasn't able to store messages, so conversation logs were never kept.\n\nThe network was compromised by this malfunctioning node.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis experiment was the closest we came to successfully using LoRa to connect distant villages. Unfortunately we were just one node short.\n\nI'll hopefully be visiting Balaio again early 2022, so we've already acquired more LoRa nodes and [created a simple pub/bot which posts Meshtastic messages to SSB](%9dXJSotpDXpH6AxfcUxxxV2fQ7AOzO34Upn5JTeyV84=.sha256).\n\nSetting up LoRa networks to connect remote villages have proved to be challenging, but we've advanced quite a lot in making this technology usable and accessible.

The last girl I've had taking care of the place did an amazing job. Our deal was that she would put R$500 (90 USD) in the form of labor, dog food, and maintanance. She was very ok with me visiting and bringing friends over. But she'll be leaving in the end of January.\n\nI feel the house and land are such a amazing resource, but are being wasted. I really don't feel like renting the place for a few reasons:\n\n1. Although I've put lots of my own energy into it, the resources to buy the land the and materials to build the house came to me in a rather lucky way thru crypto speculation, I never felt I should earn more money with it\n2. It's very a very crude house, and I love it that way... renting would mean having to have a certain standard of housing which isn't my thing\n3. Renting means more responsability for me, and less responsability for who rents, as they'll be paying (that's how Brasil works)\n\n![](&nGbWI4ymy8mijhiSqhNpD66QFghbPwvOz06bqgIWBng=.sha256)\n\nWe've had talks in the past about Scuttle-land, and I've never stopped dreaming about a way to collectively manage a land in a way that could liberate people from bills (rent, energy, water, etc.), so that they're free to pursue what they love, as me and [@Dominic](@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519) for example have had the opportunity. I would love to turn my house into a place that brings about that possibility, even if not permanently, for people who are trying to free themselves from having to work on something they don't believe in just for surviving.\n\nObviously a single house/land wouldn't be enough for making that a reality, but the ideia is to slowly come up with a method for others, who have a the will and the resources, to also have their homes collectively managed, even if temporarly. For this to scale it's important that land/house owner's should have some form of ideological incentive and have the freedom to define time periods for land leasing.\n\nWhile I'm travelling I'd love to have my house be the test-bed for such experiment. But, when I'm not, I would need a place to stay, that's why this would beed to be temporary. I would love for my place to be used as a hub for people to gather around learning, experimenting and developing practices and technologies around topics that are important to me, for example: **renegerative agriculture, community autonomy and decolonization/re-indigenization**. But doesn't necessarly need to be about what I feel it's important.\n\n![](&mZCTsrADuIHck5YLIZ1zL1uaKWXbsMgm5xM/u0EQ0zs=.sha256)\n\nWould love to hear some thoughts, specially from some people who I remember have shown some interest in the topic in the past [@elavoie](@IgYpd+tCtXnlE2tYX/8rR2AGt+P8svC98WH3MdYAa8Y=.ed25519), [@andrestaltz](@QlCTpvY7p9ty2yOFrv1WU1AE88aoQc4Y7wYal7PFc+w=.ed25519), [@Nico Pace](@2AWm36HvcuOOcYeNgGgoybKXcMZx+COIf4/aAxJwnVI=.ed25519)...\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to such an experiment, I think of at least two ways:\n\n1. **Management**: join the discussions around the governance and how to make sure the community, land and house are well taken care of; help decide who, when and how the land will be used\n2. **Spreading the word**: the help of Brasilian butts would be fundamental for this, as I don't use any other social-media to spread the word to generate movement (looking at yous Staltz, [@SoapDog (Macbook Air)](@qv10rF4IsmxRZb7g5ekJ33EakYBpdrmV/vtP1ij5BS4=.ed25519), [@Murilo Polese](@NcgzCoOPLjSkj9Y+GIMFbhxbqIzJCOwYBn/QQDYAOmk=.ed25519), [@Rômulo Alves](@xr/Q/zqaEwmmd4wg8xRU1TrMLQhc9qBqNCioCqmv1vQ=.ed25519), etc)\n3. **Staying**: probably none here will be playing this part yet, but it's about being on the ground and exchanging knowledge and labor for having a place to stay; initially, the only costs involved I can imagine would be food, which can be found cheapily and in good quality in the village and town\n\n\n\n","type":"post","mentions":[{"link":"@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519","name":"Dominic"},{"link":"@IgYpd+tCtXnlE2tYX/8rR2AGt+P8svC98WH3MdYAa8Y=.ed25519","name":"elavoie"},{"link":"@QlCTpvY7p9ty2yOFrv1WU1AE88aoQc4Y7wYal7PFc+w=.ed25519","name":"andrestaltz"},{"link":"@2AWm36HvcuOOcYeNgGgoybKXcMZx+COIf4/aAxJwnVI=.ed25519","name":"@Nico Pace"},{"link":"@qv10rF4IsmxRZb7g5ekJ33EakYBpdrmV/vtP1ij5BS4=.ed25519","name":"@SoapDog (Macbook Air)"},{"link":"@NcgzCoOPLjSkj9Y+GIMFbhxbqIzJCOwYBn/QQDYAOmk=.ed25519","name":"@Murilo Polese"},{"link":"@xr/Q/zqaEwmmd4wg8xRU1TrMLQhc9qBqNCioCqmv1vQ=.ed25519","name":"@Rômulo Alves"},{"link":"&srD45YcnS4krd0vay2fCpbeN7/Xzs7pFsGHH4+yYm7E=.sha256","name":""},{"link":"&nGbWI4ymy8mijhiSqhNpD66QFghbPwvOz06bqgIWBng=.sha256","name":""},{"link":"&mZCTsrADuIHck5YLIZ1zL1uaKWXbsMgm5xM/u0EQ0zs=.sha256","name":""}]},"signature":"O1k+fukPIpxgnyBxv9To+i8eeuJ4rjPGKGqfkNokoBwOYy0Nzol7NQw8jAMIwgY8fYIMuKo0hqJSTEuz6labCA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1642377489565.003,"rts":1642343322553},{"key":"%i4wRYYIuwrmZ0CsAdz8ZJ+RRrI5ru1Sb9VZYnDf8cdM=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%Rqp+Fnkq17CQROyZquoOdfzZoDz06B78QkBZdHTirgo=.sha256","author":"@0uOwBrHIeiRK7lcvpLwjSFkcS3UHSQb/jyN52zf+J6Y=.ed25519","sequence":2992,"timestamp":1642288790464,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","text":"Landed in Christchurch, New Zealand.

I've had great amazing experiences with Couchsurfing, but I feel we can do better!\n\nThanks for the support [@SoapDog (Macbook Air)](@qv10rF4IsmxRZb7g5ekJ33EakYBpdrmV/vtP1ij5BS4=.ed25519)!\n\nThose are great questions [@Big Hat](@YGy9Ur0UdoWMXwCB/lSNcwSB0VtjDWMjFO9qfHCMDNw=.ed25519)!\n\n> 1) What's the difference between what you want vs. Work Away, WWOOF, GrowingLocal, CouchSurfing, WarmShowers, etc.?\n\nI'm not really familiar with all these initiatives, I've had lots of experiences with CouchSurfing, and a bit with WWOOF. Some differences:\n- **the host figure**: that's something I'd like to eliminate, and exchange for a group of people (be them physically present or online) that will collectively manage the space\n- **required payment**: this is very lame... I think it should only be required to install some FOSS software to participate\n- **focus on travel**: I'd like for this to have less a focus on travel and more on autonomy and lifestyles that support it\n\n> 2) What's your dream for the space?\n\nOur focus has always been in cultivating the soil and raising photosynthesis potential, not producing, although we've produced lots. It's also a great place to just hang out.\n\nIt would be great to have a collective agreed purpose for the cultivated land, but I don't want to be the one to set that. My dream is to have a collective dream for the space. Invite people to dream together and to collectively decide who gets to stay, for how long.\n\n> 3) Do you want to produce anything for the local economy / metabolism (with or without money)?\n\nNot my initial idea. I would personally love to see knowledge produced and spread on the space. But if the collective decides on doing such experiment with producing goods, I see no problem. It should be primarly a space for experimentation.\n\n> 4) What participation might neighbors have with the house and the plants?\n\nI actually have something like that going on, but it's always under-used, as neighbors also have land of their own to care for. The neighborhood is really in need for a space to run collective child daycare, I would love to see that happening. Would be awesome people staying to support that effort in every way possible.\n\n> My opinion: If you want a vibrant agroforestry garden, someone local has to be responsible for maintaining the garden.\n\nThe beaulty of agroforests is that they become self-maintained after a while, and mine is close to that point. The [irrigation system](%Q0On77rWOlOzYXl3vMFzaBIgUgDRgBs4ovkDbbsFyr8=.sha256) should keep it alive, and my occasional visits have been enough to keep it pruned.\n\nBut that's a great point, I've been [experimenting with Mapeo to manage agroforests](https://wp.digital-democracy.org/mapeo-agroflorestal/), specifically thinking on such a case. Ideally we'd collectively find a way to make the complexity of agroforests acessible to new-comers. Could even be one of the main purposes of the land.\n\n[@Mix Android](@G98XybiXD/amO9S/UyBKnWTWZnSKYS3YVB/5osSRHvY=.ed25519), that's an interesting take on defining LAND like you define an API. Got me thinking.\n\n[@elavoie](@IgYpd+tCtXnlE2tYX/8rR2AGt+P8svC98WH3MdYAa8Y=.ed25519), I love where you're getting at.\n\n> As a community if some of us go to places with strong currencies but intentionally live with much less, and help fund another bunch of us in experimenting with intentional community living in place with really cheap land, low cost of living, and abundant nature services, we can go in a much longer way. But there needs to be a common vision of where we are going together to make the affluence \"sacrifice\" on the one end worth it, and a form of responsibility towards the larger project on the other end to contribute back to the international community.\n\nThis is gold! Reaching a **common vision** is the challenge here. I think it's about gardening a community that is both online and physical, and getting them in sync with each other.\n\n> How close are you guys to the ocean?\n\nReally far, we're in the middle of Brasil.\n\n> I feel like I am basically arguing for international trade... to have a direct multi-dimensional relationships with some of the trade partners\n\nThis is actually really cool, and it's what I think might be missing from other similar initiatives. What's the best way to connect people roaming around, to communities where they can be the most welcomed and the most useful?\n\nThanks all for the feedback, I've got several notes on next steps and ideas for methodologies to run this. I'll organize them better and post asap.\n\n  ","type":"post","root":"%mtjG7p3VTtza2dYHf5kotgDSEOdBzeYfHKwq6Q+NCb8=.sha256","mentions":[{"link":"@QlCTpvY7p9ty2yOFrv1WU1AE88aoQc4Y7wYal7PFc+w=.ed25519","name":"andrestaltz"},{"link":"@Gs0Rz7yEabDd1GyrnjZ1acPrcHL+rx8irnLl4ys/sU4=.ed25519","name":"trav"},{"link":"@qv10rF4IsmxRZb7g5ekJ33EakYBpdrmV/vtP1ij5BS4=.ed25519","name":"@SoapDog (Macbook Air)"},{"link":"@YGy9Ur0UdoWMXwCB/lSNcwSB0VtjDWMjFO9qfHCMDNw=.ed25519","name":"@Big Hat"},{"link":"%Q0On77rWOlOzYXl3vMFzaBIgUgDRgBs4ovkDbbsFyr8=.sha256","name":"irrigation system"},{"link":"@G98XybiXD/amO9S/UyBKnWTWZnSKYS3YVB/5osSRHvY=.ed25519","name":"@Mix Android"},{"link":"@IgYpd+tCtXnlE2tYX/8rR2AGt+P8svC98WH3MdYAa8Y=.ed25519","name":"elavoie"}],"branch":"%Z8MVQJ18LbeqWkjpo0NiGVxR/X5LLgE6wEr6Ir56t9M=.sha256"},"signature":"v14l7NT5l5/GI3lk3+O01ehTNtuzvCe9nVh5bHmVySWT43/arjoF0dfHYhhyQsp8eaDqALBKzEntpmtzup6GBw==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1643287193932,"rts":1643287084126},{"key":"%/c+3mw8+F9jUwjwZ1WsJwtaTAYL2COKywssJ3ZmHrek=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%C3MBQxrtof1RJGUzwcT44f8CzPLzl7Fj760DC+G+EeU=.sha256","author":"@0uOwBrHIeiRK7lcvpLwjSFkcS3UHSQb/jyN52zf+J6Y=.ed25519","sequence":3009,"timestamp":1643261234791,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","text":"### MIQ Managed Quarantine In New Zealand\n\nThe last 10 days my son and I were in a New Zealand government run quarantine hotel. They setup this system at the start of the pandemic to keep covid from getting in to the country. It's mostly worked, until omicron. \n\nIt was super hard to get our voucher, we had to through 5 rounds of online lotteries until we could book a date. Which is kind of amazing considering only residents, citizens, and a few critical workers are even allowed to enter the lottery. \n\nThe system of booking it, was terrible, a horrible dystopian mess. An online lottery to get a voucher to enter government quarantine on an island without a pandemic disease. Pure sci-fi made real.\n\nBut once we got here, everybody was super nice. The hotel was really nice, the food was delivered three times a day, it was ok, it got old after a week, but fine. The beds were comfortable, we were allowed out a couple times day to walk around a cement tile yard.

On top of that, there's a [private group spec](https://github.com/ssbc/private-group-spec) which has been implemented for  #ahau and is in the roadmap for planetary and manyverse. My hope is we roll out private groups, and also migrate to use bamboo style feeds that the p2panda folks are developing. With those innovations, I think we'd be comfortable advocating that healthy communities can be built on ssb which protect users.

This is not like that. \n\n\n![IMG_4657.jpeg](&M4Nj59763oU8wjVKOuQygWnQo2pvv+eiXiU43L1gyQQ=.sha256)\n\n![IMG_4806.jpeg](&+Mjz2waR/DsTPR09cpSIzosizrCVaNNg6/zx1rtdKYE=.sha256)\n\n![IMG_4811.jpeg](&qKamdx/hhOhJif5Rnnzx3+cx2SSxovf/VspS3TzdzCc=.sha256)\n![IMG_4804.jpeg](&gvzowrfudjKeNtjRi/E2IoMJ+F0IYhXbMpU4QeYoFDw=.sha256)\n![IMG_4803.jpeg](&7X4z7qfXlAwvUj0UZfHAVVzN9DwaprpZuSPOamNXbhM=.sha256)\n![IMG_4802.jpeg](&Z+Mf9exzOrKDr6/AIqHR/kf96sVOrzexjBaaVwE2Lh8=.sha256)\n![IMG_4800.jpeg](&clP/hTgP/ahyA6ze47538nTBMFsnjkskFmloP8Dik24=.sha256)\n![IMG_4729.jpeg](&ZEiS4GyN7YGTmtapl1uk6bZIzmg4yLxS/8JVmhvxW3g=.sha256)\n","mentions":[{"link":"&M4Nj59763oU8wjVKOuQygWnQo2pvv+eiXiU43L1gyQQ=.sha256","name":"IMG_4657.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg","size":4669903},{"link":"&+Mjz2waR/DsTPR09cpSIzosizrCVaNNg6/zx1rtdKYE=.sha256","name":"IMG_4806.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg","size":1556290},{"link":"&qKamdx/hhOhJif5Rnnzx3+cx2SSxovf/VspS3TzdzCc=.sha256","name":"IMG_4811.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg","size":2729293},{"link":"&gvzowrfudjKeNtjRi/E2IoMJ+F0IYhXbMpU4QeYoFDw=.sha256","name":"IMG_4804.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg","size":2738430},{"link":"&7X4z7qfXlAwvUj0UZfHAVVzN9DwaprpZuSPOamNXbhM=.sha256","name":"IMG_4803.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg","size":3124403},{"link":"&Z+Mf9exzOrKDr6/AIqHR/kf96sVOrzexjBaaVwE2Lh8=.sha256","name":"IMG_4802.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg","size":3677688},{"link":"&clP/hTgP/ahyA6ze47538nTBMFsnjkskFmloP8Dik24=.sha256","name":"IMG_4800.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg","size":2154588},{"link":"&ZEiS4GyN7YGTmtapl1uk6bZIzmg4yLxS/8JVmhvxW3g=.sha256","name":"IMG_4729.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg","size":2011860}]},"signature":"ob/qIzqlkPFT7bbfnlUESMG0Nhjema65du+Vu/AqFDIZesqnFI6h16i/Y1lSovccIFd3GfO4FjTVWmDaP2eGDw==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1646248911885,"rts":1646248426884},{"key":"%tQzy49cmNLEOEGTz3/X3BCwp/NMtINgq8l861kG7RT8=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%HQ979+UGdjg/EkWh3iSOjOaEfP5LO4AK+ZY76hdBJmE=.sha256","sequence":3531,"author":"@THUzexG1y6kWofwiN8Lix/jNH/P6roYdlCDgpAn2HSc=.ed25519","timestamp":1646255808679,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","root":"%3xdvNgml+9kU5LexyUCnzjg9TduQnzrbBKNkVrkKaLw=.sha256","fork":"%BQn7ciipPy4hG8L8eNxWYjCCFf5CR2t5mpXBx+HMSeU=.sha256","branch":"%geuAMzNioKGkHMShwFr6yLQ4j0/ZW4SFUPEQ6/IM4Lc=.sha256","reply":{"%3xdvNgml+9kU5LexyUCnzjg9TduQnzrbBKNkVrkKaLw=.sha256":"@b0e9vLp8gLDnO2EZY90IpQ2s2srEm4RYYr7VbRkLmQw=.ed25519","%geuAMzNioKGkHMShwFr6yLQ4j0/ZW4SFUPEQ6/IM4Lc=.sha256":"@s/TB/XuOzow9O5E6PVM2l0aJ8NX1BXZsRF9D8DlZggM=.ed25519"},"channel":null,"recps":null,"text":"[@Nico __mac__](@s/TB/XuOzow9O5E6PVM2l0aJ8NX1BXZsRF9D8DlZggM=.ed25519) Or Argentina which has a much more intense protest culture than the US. ;-D ","mentions":[{"link":"@s/TB/XuOzow9O5E6PVM2l0aJ8NX1BXZsRF9D8DlZggM=.ed25519","name":"Nico mac"}]},"signature":"8t/sTSrVMHVZ5YFW2VPORtdNH1j1bn/wdyiXyyXtDEP9pztZLac0T6uyTI0ssSzdiJXOo98QBPg+drbN+z5PAw==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1646255814078,"rts":1646255808679},{"key":"%V5m1QkfEdHx7HlJxo9gDmpsbvQPXRMlUwyLi4jpM7LQ=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%i0PvOBwbtWQIjOAqEOkU/WDhTpyOdNI11V5wpo+a5kI=.sha256","author":"@0uOwBrHIeiRK7lcvpLwjSFkcS3UHSQb/jyN52zf+J6Y=.ed25519","sequence":3064,"timestamp":1646272891831,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","text":"## My thoughts on #strategy2022 \n\n### Who\n\nI'm [rabble](https://evan.henshaw-plath.com), I'm a mid 40 year old parent, born in the US, lived back and forth between Latin America (mostly Uruguay) and the US and I've recently immigrated to New Zealand.\n\nIt's been a while since I told my story, so I hope you don't mind me digressing with some background. \n\nLike most hackers I started when I was a kid and was drawn to computers. In the 1990's I was involved in the environmental direct action movement Earth First! Later, I dropped out of college and somehow started a company building a SaaS calendaring app, which I also turned in to the activist site [protest.net](https://protest.net). The company wasn't particularly successful, but the online activism lead me to help create the [direct action media network](https://greatnonprofits.org/org/the-direct-action-media-network-inc) and from there at the 1999 WTO protests, helping create [indymedia](http://indymedia.org). It was in this work that I first met and started working with [@linda](@y4JVsEFT7ftd3/833JqWT2cSBfQK/GPsjdpQog1gNPs=.ed25519). I spent the next 4 years traveling around the world helping social movements with tech and trying to figure out how to use technology as a leverage for social change.\n\nIt was in that work that I was the first contractor, ne employee of, [odeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeo), which wanted to democratize podcasting. When the company wasn't a success after apple integrated podcasting in to iTunes, I suggested we start playing with sms and we built [twitter in part as an iteration on the activist tool txtmob](https://design-justice.pubpub.org/pub/0v6035ye/release/2). Lest, anybody think that I'm some amazing capitalist, I managed to get all of $7000 from my shares in Twitter. \n\nI've always been fascinated with how we can build tech that empowers people to create a more just self governed socio-economic system. The last few years that's become a focus on what digital cooperatives and more importantly a commons might mean as an alternate future instead of a world which is dominated by either the state in the Chinese model or the corporation in the western model. \n\nI got involved in scuttlebutt when I met some of the folks like Dominic and Mix through [Enspiral](https://www.enspiral.com/). Those connections are what eventually lead me to move to New Zealand. \n\nI've worked at a lot of startups, founded some. I think I'm pretty good at understanding complex systems, making sense of them, and translating that messy reality in to software. For what it's worth, I'm sure that my experience with Twitter had made it easier for me to raise money from investors. \n\nThat said,  I haven't given up my the activism and direct action. During the Black Lives Matter protests in Portland I showed up every night for many months. I have been tear gassed more times than I can count. And I'm [suing the Portland Police](https://www.wweek.com/news/2020/09/04/in-legal-claim-protester-says-portland-police-stole-his-speakers-for-playing-the-national-anthem-during-arrests/) for the violation of my civli rights.

I don't expect it to be prefect, but I do think we can get it to a similar level to mastodon. The planetary app needs to work, you need to be able to find people or groups you're interested in, connect to them, read their posts, write, and generally use the app. It needs to be responsive, provide notifications of when there are new things, and be enjoyable to post things using it. That includes a web and android version of planetary, although I'm not sure we'll get there with android. \n\nThis means a solid reusable and scalable database and go-ssb layer that we and others can build on. An app which is fast, helps you find who you're interested in quickly, connect, understand what's happening, and looks great. \n\nSecond, is protocol work. I think we need to be able to support user privacy. Right now SSB doesn't really do that. We need to be able to post to all of our followers, and only have them be able to read them messages. We need to be able to scope who can see our follow's and blocks. We need users to be able to request content be deleted by peers, or post emphemeral content which doesn't stay around forever. \n\nI'd also like to see partial feed replication, multi device support (fusion identities), multifeed support. I like the stuff [@cel](@f/6sQ6d2CMxRUhLpspgGIulDxDCwYD7DzFzPNr7u5AU=.ed25519) has done with DID's and I think it'd be cool to have better support for DID's in SSB. Provide a way to verify that I'm also [@rabble](https://twitter.com/rabble) on twitter. \n\nI think the DAO discussion is interesting, if there was a way to create a fund to provide more sustaining funding for developers working on SSB, that'd be great. Maybe revive Dominic's idea of a scuttlebutt society. If folks got money for 6 months or a year of work instead of a month then it'd be a lot easier for people to focus and make it their priority. The NGI grants seem to be doing this, which is great. \n\nThe commons. [@matt](@kS1GT34Sg+Kzjcqoehz//afmIQC5+CGo8O/KvMddVrM=.ed25519) mentioned this. I'm [a big fan of the concept](https://geo.coop/articles/tactics-cooperative-digital-commons) and the idea that we can create something of value that we share in and is self governing. \n\nI think it gives us a theoretical model for understanding how scuttlebutt and the larger world we're creating with free software can exist apart from both the state and private ownership.  \n\nWhen I think about my strategic vision for scuttlebutt, a lot of it is around making it some place that people can use without much technical knowledge. In creating a save and humane place, we need to make it [well managed a commons](https://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons). I use these 8 principles from [Elinor Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom) as a guide for what we should be building if we want a commons vs state or private ownership.  \n\n1. Define clear group boundaries.\n2. Match rules governing use of common goods to local needs and conditions.\n3. Ensure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying the rules.\n4. Make sure the rule-making rights of community members are respected by outside authorities.\n5. Develop a system, carried out by community members, for monitoring members’ behavior.\n6. Use graduated sanctions for rule violators.\n7. Provide accessible, low-cost means for dispute resolution.\n8. Build responsibility for governing the common resource in nested tiers from the lowest level up to the entire interconnected system.\n\nFiguring this out is critical to creating a space we want to occupy, but also defending it from being abused, overrun, or enclosed. I think we need to both treat the thing we're creating as developers & designers as a commons, but also make space for users to construct their own commons that they run according to their rules. Instead a single set of rules and norms, we need many, with many communities self managing their spaces. \n\nSome of the things SSB already meets the principles, but won't scale. Like for the moment we've got clear group boundaries, are you on the main scuttlebutt network or not. To a lesser degree, it's also about which pubs you use. But if we had millions of people, that wouldn't work. How do we define what the rules are and what are the enforcement mechanisms. We haven't even gone from blocking, which is really a mute and negative social signal about a person, to TrustNet. \n\nUsers on scuttlebutt can also set another network key as Ahau.io has done and then they're much more clearly separated as a group from others.\n\nThis year I'd like to work out a clear analysis about how scuttlebutt does and doesn't uphold the principles of an effective commons. By design, we can't control the scuttleverse it either with private property or the state, so we've gotta figure out how to make our commons work.\n\nI'd like to build in to the protocol and implementations more tools for self governance of the the interlocking network of commonses. I think that gives us a path towards scaling ssb, building tools and spaces which can contest the power and control of centralized social media companies. \n\nI'd love there to be many apps, many subnetworks, many communities, all using scuttlebutt.

crafting them\n- **Regenerative tech**: hope to investigate and contribute more to tools that enable the development and sharing of knowledge and experiences around regenerative practices such as agroforestry\n\n## Possible collaborations\n\n- Collaborate more with [@nonlinear](@mUNqmOd/uRBGbk9YMOzaUypf/6aPhxYI0lk6+hRyyK4=.ed25519) and others to make onboarding and overral user-flow smoother

and brainstorm new ones, no funding or support yet, as it's so new⚠️\n\nI think I'm pretty well off for 2022, with freedom to work creativily, while also being supported. There are some chunks (LoRa + SSB and documentation) that might be good to get some extra support to accelerate things, but lack of it won't halt the projects. And the Agroforestry Event, well it's still being born, support is very welcome, but haven't put as much energy into it as I would like.\n\n:pray:","type":"post","root":"%k8iNLs37CKfp4FzdxgPa1RzK2kHC7+CGkPWZoLOf7kU=.sha256","mentions":[{"link":"@G98XybiXD/amO9S/UyBKnWTWZnSKYS3YVB/5osSRHvY=.ed25519","name":"@Mix Android"},{"link":"%Kn1yjgA8eXi9cusnp6jpApqk2R3wbYs3UzCl8YLSQpo=.sha256","name":"P2P-AP"},{"link":"#dweb"},{"link":"%djrotK2IOBWxvp2+XldV9x0/65f0psbsy9aIffoPtGc=.sha256","name":"CoolabCamp"}],"branch":"%/PUS3+JJgjZ28YwWE+lp+1Y2VlWz5ZuOhRhj6vp4zNI=.sha256"},"signature":"3wXZcL5z2hkUJ685c0yH2DDbNhDRH3HupcVDfSgRtFkQTN+Gx54wdaS2c4MZPADTFMbcHQRzofj5Hie5ssryDA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1646479939237,"rts":1646479934889},{"key":"%yW9SK9QTh3/FOCq/dI46Z6unJ7jh9iGEKziNeCqkM6g=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%Cf5n+/9rf8qju2I22zosg7tJEsFDFi21d0IIRJrt2NA=.sha256","sequence":9065,"author":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","timestamp":1646480691499,"hash":"sha256","content":{"text":"[@notplants](@5Pt3dKy2HTJ0mWuS78oIiklIX0gBz6BTfEnXsbvke9c=.ed25519), this is really interesting!

The community of server farmers exists on land in right relation with the traditional stewards of the region. I envision one such server farm outside the city limits of Detroit, where the Anishinaabe, Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi have navigated the land for centuries. Our presence was sanctioned by the indigenous communities that traditionally used the land and they have access to all the servers they want and need. We work together to make sure our disruption of the regular coming and goings of flora and fauna are minimized, finding natural clearings and erecting structures that fit the landscape and diffuse the energy and heat generated by the power required to run the servers. To that end, there are internet quiet hours, where the internet sleeps as we do, light pollution is eradicated, and electrical waves are reduced. We can communicate with similar such communities around the world by essentially writing letters back and forth that may reach our (pin) pals instantly but are only opened in the light of day in the time zone received.\n\n*by [Moya Bailey](https://just-tech.ssrc.org/our-network/moya-bailey/)*\n\nSource: [https://just-tech.ssrc.org/articles/an-ethical-internet/](https://just-tech.ssrc.org/articles/an-ethical-internet/)\n\nVia [@Hiure](@TMz3wLnXWIEOWUoLiE0tnqT8JerD3TBFiCPyofN28K8=.ed25519) ","type":"post","mentions":[{"link":"@TMz3wLnXWIEOWUoLiE0tnqT8JerD3TBFiCPyofN28K8=.ed25519","name":"Hiure"}]},"signature":"Marx0Ap3gTjEz/gkpS1fRwkRXKthNeGCKv1saNftakhTPdd5DgXA64v3MXY9KXy8CrUOJ7Cd1uKLibVLivABBw==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1646663825068,"rts":1646568597700},{"key":"%6Ibev2aW3aofhTUhmfvWc/JSEFu9KcYC6yrtgzpGYug=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%REAuPIjtmBCOrTVTNT89OSLnrUbBCW7d4iIHbbdQEkE=.sha256","author":"@0uOwBrHIeiRK7lcvpLwjSFkcS3UHSQb/jyN52zf+J6Y=.ed25519","sequence":3069,"timestamp":1646533722965,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","text":"I went for a bike ride around #Wellington but unfortunately I didn’t see any pingüinos. \n\n![planetary attachment no.1](&WZyGvjPI326xvhydsc4Na2SFahz8ua5bd1yLwHTXPcg=.sha256)\n![planetary attachment no.2](&yyuL5RnhkGAxi13utj6aoAImS2DFP1lFA0ulLSUkWVw=.sha256)","mentions":[{"link":"#Wellington"},{"size":152747,"type":"image/jpeg","width":4032,"height":3024,"link":"&WZyGvjPI326xvhydsc4Na2SFahz8ua5bd1yLwHTXPcg=.sha256"},{"size":105321,"type":"image/jpeg","width":4032,"height":3024,"link":"&yyuL5RnhkGAxi13utj6aoAImS2DFP1lFA0ulLSUkWVw=.sha256"}]},"signature":"XvqoHz3N95Ithf6mwTJk2P1WXNYq2c4OYI78g3RTNJyU5ckYq1undnlYprM1qG3mL0abggF3H+FgHcebcPlhAg==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1646663825159,"rts":1646533722965},{"key":"%t8JZ5wFHerh/PQRZJTLSXc0wpgCdIWnXuwoDxpaV8sA=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%nZYpq6wdrkqEflEU4PgRph4t0XresKTZDvDJ6EvrgYI=.sha256","sequence":9084,"author":"@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519","timestamp":1646568815156,"hash":"sha256","content":{"text":"Yup [@Mix Android](@G98XybiXD/amO9S/UyBKnWTWZnSKYS3YVB/5osSRHvY=.ed25519), we're probably going to write a proposal via #coolab and [Portal Sem Porteiras](https://portalsemporteiras.github.io/).","type":"post","root":"%k8iNLs37CKfp4FzdxgPa1RzK2kHC7+CGkPWZoLOf7kU=.sha256","mentions":[{"link":"@G98XybiXD/amO9S/UyBKnWTWZnSKYS3YVB/5osSRHvY=.ed25519","name":"@Mix Android"},{"link":"#coolab"}],"branch":"%3JzEECT0xoMsBCwgDPx176A4uGiFqfdd7KWXR0nfx/w=.sha256"},"signature":"XwDwdPe720PmPeXGur7/xWkITZlAk/SrE9FGa2aHNh4UtqemIjWaFW0S4jdmi4141TN89Q1BvNz302x7kwnADA==.sig.ed25519"},"timestamp":1646663825161,"rts":1646568815156},{"key":"%AKU+gh3GKF56lCWY2awbcl48ukOx+lPgTy1dEGSqNzo=.sha256","value":{"previous":"%6Ibev2aW3aofhTUhmfvWc/JSEFu9KcYC6yrtgzpGYug=.sha256","author":"@0uOwBrHIeiRK7lcvpLwjSFkcS3UHSQb/jyN52zf+J6Y=.ed25519","sequence":3070,"timestamp":1646543894344,"hash":"sha256","content":{"type":"post","text":"I’m making myself a desk and I made a mistake.

For instance, our Internet-deployed reputation functions and ledger-based storage of reputation data. IPv8 is designed as a mechanism to build trust. Each network overlay offers network connections to known digital identities through public keys. Overlays are robust against several network problems and security issues. Using a custom NAT-traversing DHT to find the current IPv4 network address, IPv8 keeps the network connectivity going, even as the IPv4 addresses change. Each network overlay keeps track of a number of neighbors and occasionally checks if they are still responsive.\n\n> IPv8 offers global connectivity through integrated UDP NAT puncturing, announcement of your identity claim and a web-of-trust. IPv8 has an integrated attestation service. You can use IPv8 for official verification that something is true or authentic, according to a trustworthy attestor. By using zero-knowledge proofs we attempt to minimize privacy leakage.\n\nWhich references two papers, [UDP NAT and Firewall Puncturing in the Wild](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01597969/document) and [Dispersy Bundle Synchronization](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/EWI/Over%20de%20faculteit/Afdelingen/Software%20Technology/Distributed%20Systems/Technical%20Reports/2013/PDS-2013-002.pdf). Both of which are by [Johan Pouwelse](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pprQKjUAAAAJ&hl=en) who is the founder of [Tribler](https://www.tribler.org/). \n\nIt seems like Tor meets Bittorrent meet ActivityPub. I can't tell if anybody's using it, but it looks interesting to me. Having more rigorous academic focus behind it is good. TrustChain seems a lot like ssb, the Tribler mega app is an odd mix of a ton of things.

The NGI pointer grant was a huge step forward for SSB, and it's a shame there isn't ongoing funding for that work.\n\nThe idea of better code governance is good, it'd also be interesting to see how we build governance tools in to users of the protocol. Right now private groups are centered around the idea of small egalitarian groups where everybody has administrative rights and visibility in to other members. That's good for some groups. But other group from would be good to build. \n\nThe one i'd like is to be able to set your feed as private, encrypting it and providing a read key in a private message to everybody who you want to be following you. It's kind of a one way group, but it feels like that'd be really useful for folks. Especially the people who are vulnerable based on who they are or what they talk about. Just trusting somebody will follow public web hosting rules, or even have a well behaved ssb node, isn't a long term solution.  \n\nAs [@andrestaltz](@QlCTpvY7p9ty2yOFrv1WU1AE88aoQc4Y7wYal7PFc+w=.ed25519) said, the private groups and fusion identity stuff would be great, it's something i'd love planetary to support. \n\nToday we had a conversation on the planetary team about a fediverse gateway.

We were having a discussion about this today, unrelated to this thread but basically the same idea. What to do with a ton of encrypted unreadable messages from other users. At some point, you might get added to the group, and be able to decrypt them, but that's unlikely. \n\nIn the case of the planetary app we were thinking about zeroing out the data and then compacting the database to not store the unreadable encrypted messages. \n\nAnother idea [floating around is that of in-memory only feeds](%RkCQ7j7RU1U/lOS4wTOiqSaWR5w9Hp1MeLJQ9m/BStk=.sha256). You'd only be able to validate the message, not it's history, but it gives us ephemeral content, which is cool. And an in memory encrypted feed is interesting. \n\nAnyway, i think once we have metafeed support, a feed for encrypted content and another for unencrypted would totally make sense. Even maybe one for groups, one for direct private messages, and one for public. I'm not sure what would happen if there were a ton of metafeeds, but you could rotate them every 1000 messages or something, reducing the need for storage further. \n\nI think if it's on a cloud server, or a laptop, then the hosting of other people's content feels like mutual aid. But on phones they are much more resource constrained. Personally I like how ssb covers the problem of paying for storing your content with a nifty model of mutual aid and support. It works because i host my friends content, and their use of the system involves supporting me.

The [tecnology section of Ahau webpage](https://ahau.io/technology.html) has some great animations which help to visually understand some features of the protocol.\n\nThe ecosystem has evolved quite a bit, but mature apps can still be hard to understand, as they have so many unique and experimental moving parts. But for me it's about slowly understanding secreat-stack and and how plugins work with it. Manyverse is a great go-to codebase to see a stable [ssb setup](https://github.com/staltz/manyverse/blob/master/src/backend/ssb.ts). \n\nA great job is being done at [dev.scuttlebutt.nz's js section](https://dev.scuttlebutt.nz/#/javascript/?id=introduction) to explain the basics. A bit of storytelling can help:\n\n## Story: Secret Digital Society\n\n### Secret Keys\n\nImagine we're part of a Secret Digital Society which relies on the security of our communication to operate. We first start by giving each member a secret identity, which are [ssb-keys](https://dev.scuttlebutt.nz/#/javascript/?id=ssb-keys).\n\n### Secret Handshake\n\nWe then establish a secure protocol for [exchanging keys](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/#handshake) and communicating, which is [secret-stack](https://dev.scuttlebutt.nz/#/javascript/?id=secret-stack). We have to define a common language (`appKey`) for communicating and define common data models: `post` for regular messages, `about`, for profile messages, etc.\n\nA \"common language\" is generated by [ssb-caps](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-caps).\n\n### Efficient log database\n\nWe need to store those messages somewhere. So every member of our network carries a backpack with various copies of everyone's encoded messages. The way messages are organized and kept is called [ssb-db](https://dev.scuttlebutt.nz/#/javascript/?id=ssb-db2). Currently feeds follow [this pattern](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/#structure), and lots can be achieved by using it in conjunction with tangles, including [CRUT](https://gitlab.com/ahau/lib/ssb-crut) and [private-groups](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-tribes).\n\nBut a [new pattern](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/#bendy-butt) is being developed, which I still need to wrap my head around. So might be worth diving into that.\n\n### Gossip like there's no tomorrow\n\nFor establishing our social network safely, instead of relying on DHT's, ssb uses [gossip](https://scuttlebot.io/more/protocols/secure-scuttlebutt.html#gossip), which is my favorite part, as it simulates how real communities operate.\n\nAs long as another person I connect to ([ssb-conn](https://github.com/staltz/ssb-conn)) speaks the same language (`appKey`), I'll throw all my messages at them.\n\nThe path I choose to walk in order to meet people and gossip is determined by my **schedule** [ssb-replication-scheduler](https://github.com/ssb-ngi-pointer/ssb-replication-scheduler), my **social graph** [ssb-friends](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-friends), and a map to navigate the **random roads of the Internet** [ssb-ebt](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-ebt).\n\n### Where to meet people\n\n**Locally**: If we meet on the same local network, we can use [ssb-lan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ssb-lan) to discover ourselves over mdns.\n\n**[In an online room](https://www.manyver.se/blog/announcing-ssb-rooms)**: Rooms don't hold data, are very light and efficient and provide very good hole-punching like a tunnel. Easy to connect using http and provide great user-management ([go-ssb-room](https://github.com/ssb-ngi-pointer/go-ssb-room)). It's like the Secret Society Lounge, as long as you've been given access, you automatically gossip with everyone who's inside at the same time.\n\n**[In a pub](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-server/wiki/Pub-Servers)**: Pubs hold data for everyone that it follows. Follows can happen thru invites. A member of our Secret Society works as a bar tender, so he hands out invite codes to be given to trusted new members to the Society. When the person arrives with an invite at the pub, the bar tender will start gossiping all it's messages to that person and also listening to all the person's gossips.\n\n### Indexes and blobs\n\nMany other plugins are related to indexing message types (about, votes, posts, searching) and handling binary data, or blobs (storing, serving, purging).\n\n## Learning process\n\nI've personally learned about SSB by playing with the various stacks and libs. When I first fell into the rabbit, Patchwork was the best maintained app, which is very unique, so very hard to understand and tweak. So it felt easier to just build something from scratch then go thru the learning curve of SSB backend.\n\nFor me building toy-apps is the best way to learn. From the little I've worked with you [@andrew 🐝](@qvGBxH1vDasocIBYlE8yZCdWFECjzFZY1K50YcAIbLE=.ed25519), I've noticed you're quite good at grasping large complex app ecosystems, such as Mapeo's.

find feijoa in new zealand so fascinating.

You can buy it in a nursery, but really, it's just not considered something you'd eat. \n\nI wonder if it's because kiwi farmers bread them to be better as a fruit. I'm not sure. There are government projects to try and convince uruguayan farmers to plan Feijoa, but like blue berries, they're not consumed locally.

Ritual as being a powerful tool as old as humanity and engaging in a ritual practice has all sorts of mental and physical health benefits. The god stuff I think of as a metaphor for the social and ecological organisms which we are a part of but don’t understand.

That would let us connect, talk about a bunch of social and technical aspects of scuttlebutt, get to know each other in person or reconnect after the long pandemic isolation. \n\nThe dweb camp is Wednesday August 24th to August 28th. I was thinking if we had a pre-meeting say from Sunday the 21st til August 23rd we could have Saturday for travel for folks not in California. \n\nWhat do people think? Just like with the #scuttlecamp of a few years ago, planetary can help with the costs for the venue, food, and organizing. We don’t want it to be a planetary thing, the whole point is that scuttlebutt is a community created project with many apps, implementations, and a healthy diversity of people. \n\n### Travel Subsidy\n\nPlanetary helped with people’s travel costs to the #scuttlecamp and to the last #dwebcamp before the pandemic. It’d be great to see people again. So we’re offering to help with tickets this time as well. So, if you’ve been actively contributing to scuttlebutt within the last year, either through code, documentation, or organizing projects, please reach out so we can help get you to dweb camp. \n\nWe’d also like folks to think about who we should be listening to but who’s not yet got a voice. Scuttlebutt has an inclusive, solarpunk, egalitarian vision for the future. The perspective of people who aren’t straight white cis economically privileged people is important both because their voice is central to the world we want to build and because their experience in social media is shaped by systemic bias. So, if you know folks who should be in the conversation about scuttlebutt and the dweb, please reach out to nominate them. \n\n### options\n\nIn terms of venue, there are a few options. We can come and meet at my family cabin, #pantilokpom, it’s an off the grid cabin i helped build out of recycled paper (papercrete) with a pond, big barn for meetings, and sauna. It's got starlink and is setup for groups. The downside is that it’s about a 5 hour drive from san francisco, and then 5 hours to the dweb camp location.\n\n![pantilokpom cabin in a green meadow](&0/tlzgp6TDsRo0fo0047uckWXxgj0JoI7xJYs1CJIXQ=.sha256)\n\nWe could look into meeting at the dweb camp venue before the official event, that would involve us also helping setup the dweb venue space, which would be a nice collective contribution to the larger community, but would take time away from meeting about scuttlebutt. \n\nOr we could find some other place near the venue in Mendocino (2.5 hours north of san francisco) that we could rent or find somebody to donate as a meeting place. \n\nI also think we should consider how we can have an organized presence at the event, tea space, or some idea of events we'd do, i'm not sure.

Planetary shows the main tab as direct follows, and structures the extended network with a different format for posts, and does NOT pop replies back to the top. \n\nWe're working on an update which will support multiple algorithms for the feed so users can choose and developers can contribute new ones. \n\nOne thing we've noticed is planetary gets less engagement in part because we don't show follow / block messages, don't suggest follows, don't show replies/follows/blocks/likes on a users profile page, and don't pop messages back up to the top of the feed when there is a reply. My hypothesis is that these things are important and is one of the reasons why patch* and manyverse keep their users engaged longer. \n\nJust to be clear, we're not about competing with other ssb apps, it's about learning from each other.
